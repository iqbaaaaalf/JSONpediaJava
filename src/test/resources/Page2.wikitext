==Early life==
Tim Berners-Lee was born in southwest London, England, on 8 June 1955, the son of [[Conway Berners-Lee]] and [[Mary Lee Woods]].  His parents worked on the first commercially built computer, the [[Ferranti Mark 1]].  One of four children, he attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to [[Emanuel School]] in London, from 1969 to 1973.<ref name=tecb/> He studied at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first-class degree in Physics.<ref name=W3Bio/>

==Career==
[[File:Tim Berners-Lee.jpg|thumb|left|Berners-Lee, 2005]]
While an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980, Berners-Lee proposed a project based on the concept of [[hypertext]], to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Berners-Lee's original proposal to CERN|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|month=March|year=1989|url=http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref> While there, he built a prototype system named [[ENQUIRE]].<ref name="linvinginternet">{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Bill|title=Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and the World Wide Web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/w/wi_lee.htm|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>

After leaving CERN in 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, England.<ref name="faq">{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=22 July 2010|author=Tim Berners-Lee}}</ref> The project he worked on was a ''real-time remote procedure call'' which gave him experience in [[computer network]]ing.<ref name="faq" /> In 1984 he returned to CERN as a fellow.<ref name="linvinginternet" />

In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet: "I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] and [[domain name system]] ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web."<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Berners-Lee|title=Answers for Young People|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Kids|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref> “Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the Internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/ber1int-1 |title=Biography and Video Interview of Timothy Berners-Lee at Academy of Achievement |publisher=Achievement.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref> He wrote his initial proposal in March 1989, and in 1990, with the help of [[Robert Cailliau]] (with whom he shared the 1995 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Software System Award]]), produced a revision which was accepted by his manager, Mike Sendall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten Years Public Domain for the  Original Web Software|url=http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Story/WelcomeStory.html|publisher=CERN|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref> He used similar ideas to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which he designed and built the first Web browser. This also functioned as an editor ([[WorldWideWeb]], running on the [[NeXTSTEP]] operating system), and the first Web server, [[CERN HTTPd]] (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]]).

{{quotation| " Mike Sendall buys a NeXT cube for evaluation, and gives it to Tim [Berners-Lee]. Tim's prototype implementation on NeXTStep is made in the space of a few months, thanks to the qualities of the NeXTStep software development system. This prototype offers WYSIWYG browsing/authoring! Current Web browsers used in "surfing the Internet" are mere passive windows, depriving the user of the possibility to contribute. During some sessions in the CERN cafeteria, Tim and I try to find a catching name for the system. I was determined that the name should not yet again be taken from Greek mythology. Tim proposes "World-Wide Web". I like this very much, except that it is difficult to pronounce in French..." by Robert Cailliau, 2 November 1995.<ref name="Ben">[http://www.netvalley.com/cgi-bin/intval/net_history.pl?chapter=4 Roads and Crossroads of Internet History] Chapter 4: Birth of the Web</ref> }}

The first [[web site]] built was at CERN within the border of France<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Berners-Lee. Confirming The Exact Location Where the Web Was Invented|url=http://davidgalbraith.org/uncategorized/the-exact-location-where-the-web-was-invented/2343/}}</ref>, and was first put online on 6 August 1991:
<blockquote>
"Info.cern.ch was the address of the world's first-ever web site and web server, running on a NeXT computer at CERN. The first web page address was http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html, which centred on information regarding the WWW project. Visitors could learn more about hypertext, technical details for creating their own webpage, and even an explanation on how to search the Web for information. There are no screenshots of this original page and, in any case, changes were made daily to the information available on the page as the WWW project developed. You may find a later copy (1992) on the World Wide Web Consortium website." -CERN </blockquote> It provided an explanation of what the World Wide Web was, and how one could use a browser and set up a web server.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to info.cern.ch, the website of the world's first-ever web server|publisher=CERN|url=http://info.cern.ch/|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World Wide Web—Archive of world's first website|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|url=http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World Wide Web—First mentioned on USENET|publisher=Google|date=6 August 1991|url=http://groups.google.co.uk/group/alt.hypertext/msg/06dad279804cb3ba?dmode=source&hl=en|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The original post to alt.hypertalk describing the WorldWideWeb Project|publisher=Google|work=[[Google Groups]]|date=9 August 1991|url =http://groups.google.com/group/comp.archives/browse_thread/thread/9fb079523583d42/37bb6783d03a3b0d?lnk=st&q=&rnum=2&hl=en#37bb6783d03a3b0d|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref>

In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at MIT. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they could easily be adopted by anyone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patent Policy—5&nbsp;February&nbsp;2004|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=5 February 2004|url=http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref>

In 2001, Berners-Lee became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage Trust, having previously lived in [[Colehill]] in [[Wimborne Minster|Wimborne]], [[East Dorset]], England.<ref>John W.

In June 2009 then British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] announced Berners-Lee would work with the UK Government to help make data more open and accessible on the Web, building on the work of the Power of Information Task Force.<ref>{{cite web| title = Tim Berners-Lee| publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date= 10 June 2009| url = http://www.w3.org/News/2009#item98| accessdate=10 July 2009  }}</ref> Berners-Lee and Professor [[Nigel Shadbolt]] are the two key figures behind [[data.gov.uk]], a [[UK Government]] project to open up almost all data acquired for official purposes for free re-use. Commenting on the opening up of [[Ordnance Survey]] data in April 2010 Berners-Lee said that: "The changes signal a wider cultural change in Government based on an assumption that information should be in the public domain unless there is a good reason not to—not the other way around." He went on to say "Greater openness, accountability and transparency in Government will give people greater choice and make it easier for individuals to get more directly involved in issues that matter to them."<ref>{{cite news| title = Ordnance Survey offers free data access |publisher=BBC News |date= 1 April 2010| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8597779.stm| accessdate=3 April 2009  }}</ref>

In November 2009, Berners-Lee launched the World Wide Web Foundation in order to "Advance the Web to empower humanity by launching transformative programs that build local capacity to leverage the Web as a medium for positive change."<ref>[http://www.webfoundation.org/about/faq/ FAQ—World Wide Web Foundation] Retrieved 18 January 2011</ref>

Berners-Lee is one of the pioneer voices in favour of [[Net Neutrality]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7613201.stm|title=Web creator rejects net tracking|publisher=BBC |date= 15 September 2008|accessdate=15 September 2008|quote=Warning sounded on web's future.|first=Pallab|last=Ghosh}}</ref> and has expressed the view that [[ISP]]s should supply "connectivity with no strings attached," and should neither control nor monitor customers' browsing activities without their expressed consent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7299875.stm|title=Web creator rejects net tracking|publisher=BBC |date= March 2008|accessdate=25 May 2008|quote=Sir Tim rejects net tracking like Phorm.|first=Rory|last=Cellan-Jones}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1581938/Web-inventor%27s-warning-on-spy-software.html|title=Web inventor's warning on spy software|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= March 2008|accessdate=25 May 2008|quote=Sir Tim rejects net tracking like Phorm.

In a ''[[The Times|Times]]'' article in October 2009, Berners-Lee admitted that the initial pair of slashes ("//") in a web address were actually "unnecessary". He told the newspaper that he could easily have designed URLs not to have the slashes. "There you go, it seemed like a good idea at the time," he said in his lighthearted apology.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8306631.stm|title=Berners-Lee 'sorry' for slashes|publisher=BBC |date= 14 October 2009|accessdate=14 October 2009}}</ref>
