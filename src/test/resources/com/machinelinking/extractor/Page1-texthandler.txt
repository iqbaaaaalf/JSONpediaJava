Albert Einstein (<i>[iconˈælbərt_ˈaɪnstaɪn]</i>; <i>[ˈalbɐt ˈaɪnʃtaɪn]</i>; 14 March 1879– 18 April 1955) was a German-born <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Ftheoretical+physics">theoretical physics</a></span> who developed the theory of <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fgeneral+relativity">general relativity</a></span>, effecting a revolution in <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fphysics">physics</a></span>. For this achievement, Einstein is often regarded as the father of <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fmodern+physics">modern physics</a></span>., <a class="link" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jJl2JAqvoSAC&pg=PA41"></a>.
 While best known for his <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fmass%E2%80%93energy+equivalence">mass–energy equivalence</a></span> formula ''E'' = ''mc''2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation")David Bodanis, E=mc2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation (New York: Walker, 2000)., he received the <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FList+of+Nobel+laureates+in+Physics">List of Nobel laureates in Physics</a></span> <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNobel+Prize+in+Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a></span> "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fphotoelectric+effect">photoelectric effect</a></span>". The latter was pivotal in establishing <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FIntroduction+to+quantum+mechanics">Introduction to quantum mechanics</a></span> within physics.Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNewtonian+mechanics">Newtonian mechanics</a></span> was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fclassical+mechanics">classical mechanics</a></span> with the laws of the <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Felectromagnetic+field">electromagnetic field</a></span>. This led to the development of his <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fspecial+theory+of+relativity">special theory of relativity</a></span>. He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could also be extended to <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fgravitational+fields">gravitational fields</a></span>, and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fgeneral+theory+of+relativity">general theory of relativity</a></span>. He continued to deal with problems of <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fstatistical+mechanics">statistical mechanics</a></span> and <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fquantum+mechanics">quantum mechanics</a></span>, which led to his explanations of <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fparticle">particle</a></span> and the <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBrownian+motion">Brownian motion</a></span>. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fphoton">photon</a></span> theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Funiverse">universe</a></span> as a whole.<a class="link" href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/advanced-physicsprize2011.pdf"></a> Nobelprize.org.He was visiting the United States when <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAdolf+Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a></span> came to power in 1933, and did not go back to Germany, where he had been a professor at the <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPrussian+Academy+of+Sciences">Prussian Academy of Sciences</a></span>. He settled in the U.S., becoming a citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he helped alert President <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFranklin+D.+Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a></span> that Germany might be developing an atomic weapon, and recommended that the U.S. begin similar research; this eventually led to what would become the <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FManhattan+Project">Manhattan Project</a></span>. Einstein was in support of defending the Allied forces, but largely denounced using the new discovery of <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2Fnuclear+fission">nuclear fission</a></span> as a weapon. Later, together with <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBertrand+Russell">Bertrand Russell</a></span>, Einstein signed the <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRussell%E2%80%93Einstein+Manifesto">Russell–Einstein Manifesto</a></span>, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FInstitute+for+Advanced+Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a></span> in <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPrinceton%2C+New+Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a></span>, until his death in 1955.Einstein published <span class="reference"><a href="/annotate/resource/html/http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FList+of+scientific+publications+by+Albert+Einstein">List of scientific publications by Albert Einstein</a></span> along with over 150 non-scientific works.His non-scientific works include: About Zionism: Speeches and Lectures by Professor Albert Einstein (1930), "Why War?"
