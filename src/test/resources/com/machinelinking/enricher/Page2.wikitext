{{main|Etymology of London}}
[[File:London Thames Sunset panorama - Feb 2008.jpg|thumb|The name ''London'' may derive from the [[River Thames]]]]
The [[etymology of London|etymology of ''London'']] is uncertain.<ref name="mills_139">{{Harvnb|Mills|2001|p=139}}</ref> It is an ancient name and can be found in sources from the 2nd century. It is recorded c. 121 as ''[[Londinium]]'', which points to [[Romano-British]] origin.<ref name="mills_139"/> The earliest attempted explanation, now disregarded, is attributed to [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''.<ref name="mills_139"/> This had it that the name originated from a supposed [[Lud son of Heli|King Lud]], who had allegedly taken over the city and named it ''Kaerlud''.<ref name=london_009>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/books/chapters/02-1st-ackro.html?ex=1225339200&en=b9c2c11ad6e1f435&ei=5070&pagewanted=3|title='London'|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|work=New York Times |accessdate=28 October 2008 | date=2 December 2001|isbn=978-0-7011-7279-4}}</ref>

From 1898 it was commonly accepted that the name was of [[Celts|Celtic]] origin and meant ''place belonging to a man called *Londinos''; this explanation has since been rejected.<ref name="mills_139"/> [[Richard Coates]] put forward an explanation in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-Celtic [[Old European hydronymy|Old European]] ''*(p)lowonida'', meaning 'river too wide to ford', and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the [[River Thames]] which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, ''*Lowonidonjon'';<ref name=coates>{{Cite journal|last=Coates|first=Richard|year=1998|title=A new explanation of the name of London|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|volume=96|issue=2|pages=203–229|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-968X.00027|doi=10.1111/1467-968X.00027|ref=harv| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0UqnAy | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref> this requires quite a serious amendment however. The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form ''Londinium'' with the modern Welsh ''Llundain'', which should demand a form ''*(h)lōndinion'' (as opposed to *londīnion), from earlier ''*loundiniom''; however this has proved difficult to interpret.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The possibility cannot be ruled out that the Welsh name was borrowed back in from English at a later date, and thus cannot be used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name.

Until 1889 the name "London" officially only applied to the [[City of London]] but since then it has also referred to the [[County of London]] and now [[Greater London]].<ref name="mills_140"/>

=== Prehistory and antiquity ===
[[File:Map of London, 1300.svg|thumb|In 1300 the [[City of London|City]] was still confined within the [[London Wall|Roman walls]].]]
Although there is evidence of scattered [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 43&nbsp;AD.<ref name="roman">{{Cite book |title=Roman London |last=Perring |first=Dominic |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-203-23133-3|page=1 |ref=harv }}</ref> This lasted for just seventeen years and around 61, the [[Iceni]] tribe led by [[Boudica|Queen Boudica]] stormed it, burning it to the ground.<ref name=london_010>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/timeline/romanbritain_timeline_noflash.shtml|title=British History Timeline&nbsp;—Roman Britain|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 June 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0V1GXn | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref> The next, heavily planned incarnation of the city prospered and superseded [[Colchester]] as the capital of the [[Roman Britain|Roman province]] of [[Britannia]] in 100. At its height during the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000. By the 7th century, the [[Anglo-Saxons]] had created a new settlement called [[Anglo-Saxon London|Lundenwic]] over a mile (2&nbsp;km) upstream from the old Roman city, around what is now [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].<ref name=london_011>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm|title=The early years of Lundenwic|publisher=The [[Museum of London]]|accessdate=7 June 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080610043903/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=10 June 2008}}</ref>

It is likely that there was a harbour at the mouth of the [[River Fleet]] for fishing and trading, and this trading grew, until the city was overcome by the [[Viking]]s and forced to move east, back to the location of the Roman ''Londinium'', in order to use its walls for protection.<ref name=london_012>{{cite web |url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/Onlineresources/RWWC/themes/1295/1288|title=Viking and Danish London|publisher=The [[Museum of London]]|accessdate=6 June 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080519062500/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/Onlineresources/RWWC/themes/1295/1288 <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=19 May 2008}}</ref> Viking attacks continued to increase, until 886 when [[Alfred the Great]] recaptured London and made peace with the Danish leader, [[Guthrum]].<ref name=london_013>{{cite web|url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20080602225909/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Permanent/medieval/Themes/1033/1035/default.htm|title=Medieval London&nbsp;—Vikings|publisher=The [[Museum of London]]|accessdate=7 June 2008}}</ref> The original Saxon city of Lundenwic became ''Ealdwic'' ("old city"), a name surviving to the present day as [[Aldwych]], which is in the modern [[City of Westminster]].<ref name="George Hamilton Cunningham 1927 xiii">{{Cite journal |url=http://books.google.com/?id=2fIgAAAAMAAJ |page=xiii |title=London |author=George Hamilton Cunningham |year=1927 |publisher=J.

Two recent discoveries indicate that London could be much older than previously thought. In 1999 the remains of a [[Bronze Age]] bridge were found on the foreshore north of [[Vauxhall Bridge]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Denison|first=Simon|title=First `London Bridge' in River Thames at Vauxhall|journal=British Archaeology|year=1999|month=July|issue=46|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba46/ba46news.html|accessdate=15 April 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0WdLQ0 | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref> This bridge either crossed the Thames, or went to a (lost) island in the river. Dendrology dated the timbers to 1500BC.

In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4500BC, were found on the Thames foreshore, South of Vauxhall Bridge.<ref>{{cite web|last=Milne|first=Gustav|title=London's Oldest Foreshore Structure!|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/london-s-oldest-find-discovered-at-vauxhall|work=Frog Blog|publisher=Thames Discovery Programme|accessdate=15 April 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0WtZpl | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref> The function of the mesolithic structure is not known, but it covers at least 50m x 10m, and numerous 30&nbsp;cm posts are visible at low tides. Both structures are on South Bank, at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the River Thames, and 4&nbsp;km upstream from the Roman City of London. The effort required to construct these structures implies trade, stability, and a community size of several hundred people at least.

With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London was effectively abandoned. However, from the 6th century an [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlement known as [[Anglo-Saxon London|Lundenwic]] developed slightly to the west of the old Roman city, around what is now [[Covent Garden]] and [[Strand, London|the Strand]], rising to a likely population of 10–12,000.<ref name="london_011"/> In the 9th century London was repeatedly attacked by [[Vikings]], leading to a relocation of the city back to the location of Roman ''Londinium'', in order to use its walls for protection.<ref name="london_012"/> Following the unification of [[Kingdom of England|England]] in the 10th century London, already the country's largest city and most important trading centre, became increasingly important as a political centre, although it still faced competition from [[Winchester]], the traditional centre of the kingdom of [[Wessex]].

In the 11th century King [[Edward the Confessor]] re-founded and rebuilt [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[Westminster]], a short distance upstream from London became a favoured royal residence. From this point onward Westminster steadily supplanted the City of London itself as a venue for the business of national government.<ref name=london_014>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/edward_confessor.shtml|title=Edward the Confessor (c.1003–1066)|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=27 September 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0XKDXS | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref>

During the 12th century the institutions of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. In most cases this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the [[City of Westminster]] developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre and flourished under its own unique administration, the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]]. In 1100 its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.<ref name=london_019>{{Cite book|last=Schofield|first=John|last2=Vince|first2=Alan|author2-link=Alan Vince|title=Medieval Towns: The Archaeology of British Towns in Their European Setting|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8264-6002-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Qu7QLC7g7VgC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=london+population+1100+-+1300|page=26|ref=harv}}</ref>

Brown |url=http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/london_19c.html |title=London in the Nineteenth Century |publisher=Uncp.edu |accessdate=13 December 2011}}</ref> Rising [[traffic congestion]] led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the [[London County Council]] was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital . [[The Blitz]] and other bombing by the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' during World War II killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across London. Immediately after the war, the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] were held at the original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], at a time when the city had barely recovered from the war.

In 1951 the [[Festival of Britain]] was held on the [[South Bank]]. The [[Great Smog]] of 1952 led to the [[Clean Air Act 1956]], which ended the "[[pea soup fog|pea-souper]]" fogs for which London had been notorious. From the 1940s onwards, London became home to a large number of immigrants, largely from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as [[Jamaica]], India, [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]], making London one of the most diverse cities in Europe.

Primarily starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide [[youth culture]], exemplified by the [[Swinging London]] subculture associated with the [[King's Road]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] and [[Carnaby Street]]. The role of trendsetter was revived during the [[punk rock|punk]] era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new [[Greater London Council]] was created. During [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the [[Provisional IRA]]. Racial inequality was highlighted by the [[1981 Brixton riot]]. Greater London's population declined steadily in the decades after World War II, from an estimated peak of 8.6&nbsp;million in 1939 to around 6.8&nbsp;million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to [[Port of Felixstowe|Felixstowe]] and [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury]], with the [[London Docklands]] area becoming a focus for regeneration as the [[Canary Wharf]] development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s.

The [[Thames Barrier]] was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the [[North Sea]]. The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, which left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration. In 2000, London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the [[Greater London Authority]]. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the [[Millennium Dome]], [[London Eye]] and [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] were constructed. On 7 July 2005, three [[London Underground]] trains and a [[double-decker bus]] were bombed in a [[7 July 2005 London bombings|series of terrorist attacks]].<ref name=london_031>{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/london_blasts/what_happened/html/default.stm|title=7&nbsp;July Bombings: Overview |publisher=BBC News  | location = London |accessdate=28 April 2008 |ref=harv | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5MchR94le | archivedate = 13 February 2007| deadurl=no}}</ref>

=== Scope ===
[[Greater London]] is the top-level administrative subdivision covering London. The small, ancient [[City of London]] at its core once contained the whole settlement, but as the urban area grew the [[City of London Corporation|City Corporation]] resisted attempts to amalgamate it with its suburbs, causing "London" to be defined in a number ways for different purposes; and the situation was once open to legal debate.<ref name="chancery">{{Cite journal|last=Beavan|first=Charles|coauthors=Bickersteth, Harry|title=Reports of Cases in Chancery, Argued and Determined in the Rolls Court|publisher=Saunders and Benning|year=1865|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YFYDAAAAQAAJ|ref=harv}}</ref> Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the [[London postal district|London]] post town, within which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.<ref name=london_042>{{Cite book|last=Stationery Office|title=The Inner London Letter Post|publisher=H.M.S.O|year=1980|isbn=978-0-10-251580-0|page=128|ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=map_post>{{Cite book|title=London Postcode and Administrative Boundaries|publisher=Geographers' A-Z Map Company|author=Geographers' A-Z Map Company|year=2008|edition=6|isbn=978-1-84348-592-6|ref=harv}}</ref>

Its position was formed through [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]], making its status as ''de facto'' capital a part of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|UK's unwritten constitution]].

The [[Thames Valley]] is a [[floodplain]] surrounded by gently rolling hills including [[Parliament Hill, London|Parliament Hill]], [[Addington Hills]], and [[Primrose Hill]]. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive [[marsh]]lands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.<ref name=london_065>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=M9qvtYYhRtAC&pg=PR11&dq=thames+%22iron+age%22+london+wide+geography+shallow+marsh|title=''London: A History''|first=Francis|last= Sheppard| page= 10|publisher=Google Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0-19-285369-1|accessdate=6 June 2008}}</ref>

Since the [[Victorian era]] the Thames has been extensively [[Thames Embankment|embanked]], and many of its London [[tributary|tributaries]] now flow [[Subterranean rivers of London|underground]]. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.<ref name=london_066>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/flooding/?version=1&lang=_e|title=Flooding|publisher=UK [[Environment Agency]]|accessdate=19 June 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060215080725/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/flooding/?version=1&lang=_e |archivedate = 15 February 2006}}</ref> The threat has increased over time due to a slow but continuous rise in [[Tide|high water]] level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by [[post-glacial rebound]].<ref name=london_067>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/sealevels/?version=1&lang=_e|title="Sea Levels"&nbsp;– UK Environment Agency|publisher=[[Environment Agency]]|accessdate=6 June 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080523225152/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/sealevels/?version=1&lang=_e |archivedate = 23 May 2008}}</ref>

In 1974, a decade of work began on the construction of the [[Thames Barrier]] across the Thames at [[Woolwich]] to deal with this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Adam|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/mar/31/thames-flood-barrier-london|title=Thames Barrier gets extra time as London's main flood defence|work=The Guardian  |location=UK|date=31 March 2009|accessdate=7 November 2009|ref=harv| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0n91QT | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
{{selfref|"The weather in London" redirects here. On Wikipedia, it once was long used as a deliberate example of a non-existent page in Wikipedia documentation, see [[Talk:The weather in London]] for more details.}}
London has a temperate [[oceanic climate]], similar to much of southern Britain. Despite its reputation as being a rainy city, London receives less precipitation in a year than Rome at {{convert|834|mm|in|abbr=on}}, or [[Bordeaux]] at {{convert|923|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theweathernetwork.com|title=The Weather Network|accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> Winters are generally chilly to cold with frost usually occurring in the suburbs on average twice a week from November to March. Snow usually occurs about 4 or 5 times a year mostly from December to February. Snowfall during March and April is rare but does occur every 2–3 years. Winter temperatures seldom fall below {{convert|-4|°C|°F|1}} or rise above {{convert|14|°C|°F|1}}. During the winter of 2010, London experienced its lowest temperature on record ({{convert|-14|°C|°F|1}}) in Northolt and the heaviest snow seen for almost two decades, a huge strain on London's transport infrastructure.

Summers are generally warm and sometimes hot, the heat being boosted by the [[urban heat island]] effect making the centre of London at times 5 °C (9 °F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts. London's summer average is  {{convert|24|°C|°F|1}}. On average there are 7 days a year above {{convert|30|°C|°F|1}} and 2 days a year above {{convert|32|°C|°F|1}}. Temperatures of 26 °C (80 °F) usually occur on a weekly basis from mid- June to late August.

During the [[2003 European heat wave]] there were 14 consecutive days above {{convert|30|°C|°F|1}} and 2 consecutive days where temperatures soared up to {{convert|38|°C|°F|1}}, leading to hundreds of heat related deaths. Rain generally occurs on around 2 out of 10 summer days. Spring and Autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant. On 1 October 2011, the air temperature attained {{convert|30|°C|°F|1}} and in April 2011 it reached {{convert|28|°C|°F|1}}. However in recent years both of these months have also had snowfall. Temperature extremes range from {{convert|-10|°C|°F|1}} to {{convert|37.9|°C|°F|1}}.

London's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names, such as [[Bloomsbury]], [[Mayfair]], [[Wembley]] and [[Whitechapel]]. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or [[Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London|former boroughs]].

Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without current official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 [[London borough]]s in addition to the ancient City of London.<ref name=london_071>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/boroughs.jsp|title=London boroughs&nbsp;— London Life, GLA|publisher=London Government|accessdate=3 November 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071213025156/http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/boroughs.jsp |archivedate = 13 December 2007}}</ref><ref name=london_072>{{Cite book|last=Dogan|first=Mattei|coauthors=John D.

London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular [[architectural]] style, partly due to their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the [[National Gallery]], are constructed from [[Portland stone]]. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white [[stucco]] or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666, these being a few trace [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains, the [[Tower of London]] and a few scattered [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] survivors in the City. Further out is, for example, the [[Tudor period]] [[Hampton Court Palace]], England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] c. 1515.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/hampton_court_01.shtml |title=History&nbsp;– British History in depth: Hampton Court: The Lost Palace |publisher=BBC  |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0pDL3i | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref>
[[Christopher Wren|Wren]]'s late 17th century churches and the financial institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries such as the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] and the [[Bank of England]], to the early 20th century [[Old Bailey]] and the 1960s [[Barbican Estate]] form part of the varied architectural heritage.

The disused, but soon to be rejuvenated, 1939 [[Battersea Power Station]] by the river in the southwest is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of [[Victorian architecture]], most notably [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras]] and [[Paddington railway station|Paddington]].<ref name=london_078>{{Cite journal | url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html|title=Paddington Station.|publisher=Great Buildings|accessdate=6 June 2008 | ref=harv | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0pwi86 | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref> The density of London varies, with high employment density in the [[Central London|central area]], high residential densities in [[inner London]] and lower densities in the [[Outer London|suburbs]].

[[The Monument]] in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the [[Great Fire of London]], which originated nearby. [[Marble Arch]] and [[Wellington Arch]], at the north and south ends of [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] respectively, have royal connections, as do the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] is a nationally recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], one of the focal points of the city centre. Older buildings are mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow [[London stock brick]] or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster [[moulding (decorative)|mouldings]].<ref name=london_077>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=A1&xml=/property/2008/03/27/lpgreen127.xml|title=Eco homes: Wooden it be lovely... ?|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=12 October 2008 | location=London | first=Sarah | last=Lonsdale | date=27 March 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0rvzUL | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref>

In the dense areas, most of the concentration is achieved with medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers such as [[30 St Mary Axe]], [[Tower 42]], the [[Broadgate Tower]] and [[One Canada Square]] are usually found in the two financial districts, the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]]. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and other historic buildings. Nevertheless there are a number of very tall skyscrapers to be found in central London ''(see [[Tall buildings in London]])'', including the 72-storey [[Shard London Bridge]], the [[List of tallest buildings in Europe|tallest building in Europe]].

Other notable modern buildings include [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] in [[Southwark]] with its distinctive oval shape,<ref name=london_079>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2129199.stm|title=Inside London's new 'glass egg'|date= 16 July 2002|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=26 April 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0sZ57q | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref> and the [[British Library]] in [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]]/[[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]].

== Transport ==
{{Main|Transport in London|Infrastructure in London}}
Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,<ref name=london_121>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/|title=Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=27 April 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msa508h4 | archivedate = 18 January 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref> however the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the [[London Overground]] network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by [[Transport for London]] (TfL) and is one of the most extensive in the world. [[Cycling in London|Cycling]] is an increasingly popular way to get around London. The [[London Cycling Campaign]] lobbies for better provision.<ref name=london_122>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcc.org.uk/|title=London Cycling Campaign|date=20 November 2006|publisher=Rosanna Downes|accessdate=27 April 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo1Hlskj | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref>

The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB) or ''[[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]]'' was created. [[Transport for London]] (TfL), is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the [[Mayor of London]].<ref name=stat_tfl>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp#transport|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071019055413/http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp|archivedate=19 October 2007|title=How do I find out about transport in London? |publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=5 June 2008}}</ref>
