"The  IAF - IFA  fights for : the abolition of all forms of authority whether economical, political, social, religious, cultural or sexual." "Principles of The  " "Anarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations."  . "What it Really Stands for Anarchy" in  . Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows "They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, — follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of the socialism off Karl Marg."  .  ''Individual Liberty.'' Anarchist historian   report of  's anti-authoritarianism and shows opposition to both state and non-state forms of authority as follows: "All anarchists deny authority; many of them fight against it." (pg. 9)...Bakunin did not convert the League's central committee to his full program, but he did persuade them to accept a remarkably radical recommendation to the Berne Congress of September 1868, demanding economic equality and implicitly attacking authority in both Church and State."  Proponents of anarchism, known as "anarchists", advocate  stateless societies  based on non- hierarchical "That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organization and preaches free agreement — at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist."  .  Anarchism: its philosophy and ideal "anarchists are opposed to irrational (e.g., illegitimate) authority, in other words, hierarchy — hierarchy being the institutionalisation of authority within a society."  "B.1 Why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?" in    s. "ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man’s natural social tendencies." George Woodcock. "Anarchism" at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy "In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions."  . “Anarchism” from the Encyclopædia Britannica There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive.    can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.  Strains of anarchism have been divided into the categories of  social  and   or similar dual classifications. Ostergaard, Geoffrey . "Anarchism".  The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought .

Chapter 11: Anarchist's Case . "To see this, of course, we must expound the moral outlook underlying anarchism. To do this we must first make an important distinction between two general options in anarchist theory  [... ] The two are what we may call, respectively, the socialist versus the free-market, or capitalist, versions." Tormey, Simon, Anti-Capitalism, A Beginner's Guide, Oneworld Publications, 2004, pp. 118–119.  Some individualist anarchists are also  s or  s "This stance puts him squarely in the libertarian socialist tradition and, unsurprisingly,  (Benjamin) Tucker  referred to himself many times as a socialist and considered his philosophy to be "Anarchistic socialism."

Post-left  anarcho-communist   after analysing  insurrectionary  anarcho-communist  's view on anarcho-communism went as far as saying that "communism is the final fulfillment of  .... The apparent contradiction between individualism and communism rests on a misunderstanding of both.... Subjectivity is also objective: the individual really is subjective. It is nonsense to speak of 'emphatically prioritizing the social over the individual'.... You may as well speak of prioritizing the chicken over the egg. Anarchy is a 'method of individualization'. It aims to combine the greatest individual development with the greatest communal unity." Bob Black. ''Nightmares of Reason''. "Modern Communists are more individualistic than Stirner. To them, not merely religion, morality, family and State are spooks, but property also is no more than a spook, in whose name the individual is enslaved - and how enslaved!...Communism thus creates a basis for the liberty and Eigenheit of the individual. I am a Communist because I am an Individualist. Fully as heartily the Communists concur with Stirner when he puts the word take in place of demand - that leads to the dissolution of property, to expropriation.

There is some ambiguity with the use of the terms " " and "libertarian" in writings about anarchism. Since the 1890s from France,  the term "libertarianism" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism "At the end of the century in France, Sebastien Faure took up a word originated in 1858 by one Joseph Dejacque to make it the title of a journal, Le Libertaire. Today the terms “anarchist” and “libertarian” have become interchangeable."  .

Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE-1939) « Robert Graham’s Anarchism Weblog ]  Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist "The priority of dao over tiannature:sky underwrites the themes of dependency and relativism that pervade the Zhuangzi and ultimately the skepticism, the open-minded toleration and the political anarchism (or disinterest in political activity or involvement)."  "Taoism" at the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy "Doing nothing  [wu wei] is the famous Daoist concept for natural action, action in accord with Dao, action in which we freely follow our own way and allow other beings to do likewise. Zhuangzi, the great anarchic Daoist sage, compared it to “riding on the wind.”  Max Cafard. "Zen Anarchy" "Zhuangzi helps us discover an anarchistic epistemology and sensibility. He describes a state in which “you are open to everything you see and hear, and allow this to act through you.” [45 ] Part of wuwei, doing without doing, is “knowing without knowing,” knowing as being open to the things known, rather than conquering and possessing the objects of knowledge. This means not imposing our prejudices (whether our own personal ones, our culture's, or those built into the human mind) on the Ten Thousand Things."  Max Cafard. ''The Surre(gion)alist Manifesto and Other Writings'' Zhuangzi, was referred to by   as "the first anarchist in the history of human thought"." Taoism in Ancient China "The next group of interpreters have also become incorporated into the extant version of the text. They are the school of anarchistically inclined philosophers, that Graham identifies as a “Primitivist” and a school of “Yangists,” chapters 8 to 11, and 28 to 31. These thinkers appear to have been profoundly influenced by the Laozi, and also by the thought of the first and last of the Inner Chapters: “Wandering Beyond,” and “Responding to Emperors and Kings.” There are also possible signs of influence from Yang Zhu, whose concern was to protect and cultivate one’s inner life-source. These chapters combine the anarchistic ideals of a simple life close to nature that can be found in the Laozi with the practices that lead to the cultivation and nurturing of life. "  "Zhuangzi (Chuang-Tzu, 369—298 BCE)" at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy    wrote, "A petty thief is put in jail.

Cited in George Woodcock,  Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements  (Cleveland: Meridian Books, 1962), p. 38.  Such a distinction reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not  anarchism and religion are compatible . This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful  . The radical  Protestant Christian    and his group the   are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England. "Anarchists have regarded the secular revolt of the Diggers, or True Levellers, in seventeenth-century England led by Gerrard Winstanley as a source of pride. Winstanley, deeming that property is corrupting, opposed clericalism, political power and privilege. It is economic inequality, he believed, that produces crime and misery. He championed a primitive communalism based on the pure teachings of God as comprehended through reason."  Kenneth C. Wenzer. "Godwin's Place in the Anarchist Tradition — a Bicentennial Tribute" "It was in these conditions of class struggle that, among a whole cluster of radical groups such as the Fifth Monarchy Men, the   and the Ranters, there emerged perhaps the first real proto-anarchists, the Diggers, who like the classical 19th century anarchists identified political and economic power and who believed that a social, rather than political revolution was necessary for the establishment of justice. Gerrard Winstanley, the Diggers' leader, made an identification with the word of God and the principle of reason, an equivalent philosophy to that found in  's  ." Marlow. "Anarchism and Christianity" "Although Proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was Gerrard Winstanley (1609-c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the Civil War and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army seemed intent on preserving. In 1649-1650 the Diggers squatted on stretches of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on work on the land and the sharing of goods." George Woodcock Anarchism The Encyclopedia of Philosophy  The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642, during the  , as a  term of abuse , used by  Royalists  against their   opponents.

By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation. Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the  Enlightenment , particularly  's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the  , during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.  In 1864 the   (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of  Proudhon ,   Blanquists ,  , English trade unionists,   and  . Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization.   became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the  mutualists , opposed Marx's  , advocating political   and small property holdings. In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the   (LPF), Russian revolutionary   and his  collectivist anarchist  associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).  They allied themselves with the   socialist sections of the International,  who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property. At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.  Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as  centralist  and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the   they had fought against. Anarchist historian   reports that "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse - that they had split away from the Fédération Romande - was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers."  In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the  Hague Congress , where Bakunin and   were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the  St. Imier Congress , adopting a revolutionary anarchist program. Graham, Robert ' ''Anarchism''  (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1-55164-251-4. The   was a government that briefly ruled   from March 18 (more formally, from March 28) to May 28, 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included " , the Reclus brothers , and   (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, suchas the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised...Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of  Proudhon  on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848...and for federation of communes). Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas. "The Paris Commune" by Anarcho ". George Woodcock manifests that "a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the  libertarian collectivists  Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and   and Louise Michel." 
 
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organization of labor." Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in  Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas , Vol. 1, p. 100   In 1886, the   (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the  eight-hour work day  would become standard. In response, unions across the   prepared a   in support of the event.  On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when  s attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.  The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.  A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.  In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. , 27 June 1886, quoted in   Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.  Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the  , and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight hour day was made.The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.  Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of   on   had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.

Extract of Malatesta's declaration    He thought that the trade-union movement was  reformist  and even  conservative , citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it. The  Spanish Workers Federation  in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the   (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the  .  The CNT was affiliated with the  , a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular "The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in  Mexico ,  Brazil , Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was

Some anarchists, such as  , advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda."  By the 1880s, the slogan "propaganda of the deed" had begun to be used both within and outside of the anarchist movement to refer to individual bombings,  s and  s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal ‘ expropriations ’." "Anarchist-Communism" by Alain Pengam    as a practice emerged and within it "The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (" ") and the anarchist burglars (" ") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society.

From "Anarchy: a Journal Of Desire Armed" , Fall-Winter, 1994-95  France's   was the most famous group to embrace illegalism. However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts.   thus wrote that year in  Le Révolté  that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite". quoted in Billington, James H. 1998.  Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith  New Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.  A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the   movement. The  anarcho-syndicalist ,  , argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter." State repression  (including the infamous 1894 French  ) of the anarchist and  s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French  , into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871  , the execution and exile of many   to  , favored individualist political expression and acts. Historian   thus writes:   "In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then  Versailles  seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during  's ' Terror ' of 1793–1794. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organizing on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce  Louis Napoleon 's imperialist expansion– in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ( Courbet  was its quasi-minister of culture,  Rimbaud  and   were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad."

The guarantees of the 1940 Constitution permitted them to legally create an organization of this type, and it was thus that they agreed to dissolve the two principal Cuban anarchist organizations, the SIA and FGAC, and create a new, unified group, the Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (ALC), a sizable organization with a membership in the thousands."

Mutualism began in 18th century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with   in France and others in the United States. "A member of a community,"  The Mutualist ; this 1826 series criticised  's proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge;  Wilbur, Shawn , 2006, "More from the 1826 "Mutualist"?".  Proudhon proposed  , whereby organization emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes" Proudhon,  Solution to the Social Problem , ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.  and where "business transactions alone produce the social order."  It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service. Mutualist anarchism is concerned with  reciprocity , free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to William Batchelder Greene, each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount." "Communism versus Mutualism",  Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments . (Boston: Lee  &  Shepard, 1875)  : "Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member."  Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. Avrich, Paul.

However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by   as effectively "uphold [ing ] the wages system".  Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with   but opposed the Marxist  , despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.  Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not  ; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.

Post-left  anarcho-communist   after analysing  insurrectionary  anarcho-communist  's view on anarcho-communism went as far as saying that "communism is the final fulfillment of  ...The apparent contradiction between individualism and communism rests on a misunderstanding of both...Subjectivity is also objective: the individual really is subjective. It is nonsense to speak of “emphatically prioritizing the social over the individual,”...You may as well speak of prioritizing the chicken over the egg. Anarchy is a “method of individualization.” It aims to combine the greatest individual development with the greatest communal unity." Bob Black. ''Nightmares of Reason''. Christopher Gray,  Leaving the Twentieth Century , p. 88. "Towards the creative Nothing" by   Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society. "Communism is the one which guarantees the greatest amount of individual liberty — provided that the idea that begets the community be Liberty, Anarchy...Communism guarantees economic freedom better than any other form of association, because it can guarantee wellbeing, even luxury, in return for a few hours of work instead of a day's work."  "Communism and Anarchy" by  This other society will be libertarian communism, in which social solidarity and free individuality find their full expression, and in which these two ideas develop in perfect harmony.
 ''Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists'' by Dielo Truda (Workers' Cause) "I see the dichotomies made between individualism and communism, individual revolt and class struggle, the struggle against human exploitation and the exploitation of nature as false dichotomies and feel that those who accept them are impoverishing their own critique and struggle."

Phenomena such as  ,   (e.g. within   and  ), and  the democratic process  may be sharply criticized within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones. Ted Honderich, Carmen García Trevijano,  ''Oxford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'' .

An important current within anarchism is  .  Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to   and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed   since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.  The most important American free love journal was   (1883–1907) edited by   and  , Joanne E. Passet, "Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism," in:  Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries , James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229–250.  but also there existed   and Angela Heywood's  ''The Word''  (1872–1890, 1892–1893).

" Free Society  was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century."  Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902-1909 , p.551.  The publication advocated   and  , and critiqued " " -- censorship of sexual information. Also   was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.

They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality, Sochen, June. 1972.  The New Woman: Feminism in Greenwich Village 1910–1920.  New York: Quadrangle.  and the openly bisexual radical   and the lesbian anarchist   were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by  , among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public." Katz, Jonathan Ned.  Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.  (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1976)  In fact, before Goldman,   anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal  Der arme Teufel . In Argentina anarcha-feminist   published the newspaper called   ( ), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.

 150px left thumb ,  Catalan  anarchist pedagogue and  free-thinker  For English anarchist   education was "the main means by which change would be achieved." "william godwin and informal education" by infed  Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness   For Godwin education had to have "A respect for the child’s autonomy which precluded any form of coercion", "A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child’s own motivation and initiatives" and "A concern about the child’s capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school."  In his   he criticizes state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government". Political Justice&#93; &#93; by   Early American anarchist   advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established. "Where utopian projectors starting with   entertained the idea of creating an ideal species through eugenics and education and a set of universally valid institutions inculcating shared identities, Warren wanted to dissolve such identities in a solution of individual self-sovereignty. His educational experiments, for example, possibly under the influence of the Swiss educational theorist   (via  Owen ), emphasized - as we would expect - the nurturing of the independence and the conscience of individual children, not the inculcation of pre-conceived values. "Introduction of The Practical Anarchist: Writings of Josiah Warren" by Crispin Sartwell    wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called  . In it Stirner names his educational principle "personalist," explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create "free men, sovereign characters," by which he means "eternal characters...who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment". In the United States "freethought was a basically  anti-christian ,   movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to  Liberty  (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of  Freethought  and, for a time,  The Truth Seeker . E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal  ".  "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as  ,  Freethought  and  The Truth Seeker  appeared in  Liberty ...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself". In 1901, Catalan anarchist and  free-thinker    established "modern" or  progressive schools  in   in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.  The schools' stated goal was to " educate the working class  in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.    wrote: "This period  [1890s ] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally." Chapter 7,  Anarchosyndicalism , The New Ferment . In Murray Bookchin,  The Spanish anarchists: the heroic years, 1868–1936 . AK Press, 1998, p.115. ISBN 1-873176-04-X  La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of  Modern Schools  in the  ,   ,   and  . The first of these was started in   in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper  Università popolare , founded in 1901. Russian     established a school for peasant children on his estate. "The Emergence of Compulsory Schooling and Anarchist Resistance" by Matt Hern  Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.  Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture.  He thought that "Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free.  [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary".  For him "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture". A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of   and the  free school  in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to   founding what became   in 1921.  Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice. Andrew Vincent (2010)  Modern Political Ideologies , 3rd edition, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell p.129  However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political  -approach. 
In addition to organizing schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term   was popularized by  , who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead. 
 
Criticisms of anarchism include  moral  criticisms and pragmatic criticisms.

 <An American in Paris> 
 
 thumb A theme from George Gershwin's orchestral composition ''An American in Paris'' 
 An American in Paris  is a  symphonic    by the American composer  , written in 1928. Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in  , it evokes the sights and energy of the  French  capital in the 1920s. It is one of Gershwin's best-known compositions. Gershwin composed the piece on commission from the  . He also did the   (he did not orchestrate his musicals). Gershwin scored  An American in Paris  for the standard instruments of the   plus  ,  s, and automobile horns. Gershwin brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the  New York  premiere of the composition, which took place on December 13, 1928 in  , with   conducting the  . Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer  , noting that: "My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere." When the tone poem moves into the  , "our American friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness." But, "nostalgia is not a fatal disease." The American visitor "once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life" and "the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant." 
  met Gershwin in New York during Ravel's tour of the United States. In that meeting, Gershwin asked Ravel to be his teacher, to which Ravel responded that it was better to be a first-rate Gershwin than it was to be a second-rate Ravel. Instead, Ravel recommended that Gershwin see   in Paris. Ravel's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking time to study abroad in Paris.  Gershwin arrived in Paris in March 1928. Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers:  ,  ,  ; and artist  . Gershwin met with Boulanger and at her request he played ten minutes of his music. Boulanger replied that she had nothing to teach him. This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra. 
Gershwin based  An American in Paris  on a melodic fragment called "Very Parisienne", written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer. He described the piece as a "rhapsodic ballet" because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. Gershwin explained in  , "My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere." The piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose  ABA format . Gershwin's first A episode introduces the two main "walking" themes in the "Allegretto grazioso" and develops a third theme in the "Subito con brio". The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers   and  . This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns. The B section's "Andante ma con ritmo deciso" introduces the American   and spasms of homesickness. The "Allegro" that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster  . In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. "Moderato con grazia" is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the "walking" themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final “Grandioso.” 
 An American in Paris  is scored for 3  s (3rd doubling on  ), 2  s,  , 2  s in B flat,   in B flat, 2  s, 4  horn s in F, 3  s in B flat, 3  s,  ,  ,  ,  , triangle, wood block,  s, low and high  tom-tom s,  ,  ,  , 4 taxi horns resembling the pitches A, B, C and D,  / ,  /soprano saxophone/alto saxophone,  /soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, and  strings . The revised edition by F. Campbell-Watson calls for three saxophones, alto, tenor and baritone. In this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments. 
Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of  An American in Paris . He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with "a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses." Critics believed that  An American in Paris  was better crafted than his lukewarm  Concerto in F . Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers  ,  , or   on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, "It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know… It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds." 
 An American in Paris  has been frequently recorded over the years.  The very first recording was made for   in 1929 with   conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the  .  Gershwin was on hand to "supervise" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio.  Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief   solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which  An American in Paris,  also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set.    and the   recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music.  In 1945,   and the   recorded the music in  , one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in the 1980s of Gershwin's original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today. In 1951, MGM released the musical  An American in Paris , featuring   and  .  Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by  , featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the  An American in Paris  symphonic poem (arranged for the film by  ), costing $500,000. A part of the symphonic composition is also featured in  , released in 1997.

 <Aristotle> 
 
 
 Aristotle  ( ,  Aristotélēs ) (384 BC – 322 BC) That these undisputed dates (the first half of the Olympiad year 384/3, and in 322 shortly before the death of Demosthenes) are correct was shown already by   ( Kleine Schriften  VI 195); for further discussion, see   on   244 F 38. Ingemar Düring,  Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition , Göteborg, 1957, p. 253.  was a  Greek   philosopher  and  , a student of   and teacher of  . His writings cover many subjects, including  physics ,  ,  poetry ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Together with   and   (Plato's teacher), Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in Western philosophy. Aristotle's writings were the first to create a comprehensive system of  , encompassing   and  , logic and  , politics and  . Aristotle's views on the  physical sciences  profoundly shaped medieval scholarship, and their influence extended well into the  , although they were ultimately replaced by  Newtonian physics . In the zoological sciences, some of his observations were confirmed to be accurate only in the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern  . In metaphysics,   had a profound influence on  philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions  in the  , and it continues to influence  , especially the  scholastic  tradition of the  . His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of  . All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues (  described his literary style as "a river of gold"),  it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost and only about one-third of the original works have survived. , "Life and Work" in  The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle  (1995), p. 9. 
Aristotle, whose name means "the best purpose,"  was born in  ,  , in 384 BC, about   east of modern-day  .  His father  Nicomachus  was the personal physician to  King Amyntas of Macedon . Aristotle was trained and educated as a member of the  . At about the age of eighteen, he went to   to continue his education at  Plato's Academy . Aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years before quitting Athens in 348/47 BC. The traditional story about his departure reports that he was disappointed with the direction the academy took after control passed to Plato's nephew   upon his death, although it is possible that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato had died. Carnes Lord, Introduction to  The Politics , by Aristotle (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984).  He then traveled with   to the court of his friend   in Asia Minor. While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with   to the island of  Lesbos , where together they researched the   and zoology of the island. Aristotle married Hermias's adoptive daughter (or niece)  . She bore him a daughter, whom they named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by   to become the tutor to his son   in 343 BC. Bertrand Russell, "A History of Western Philosophy", Simon  &  Schuster, 1972 thumb left upright Early Islamic portrayal of Aristotle 
Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of  . During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings:  Ptolemy  and  . In his  Politics , Aristotle states that only one thing could justify monarchy, and that was if the virtue of the king and his family were greater than the virtue of the rest of the citizens put together. Aristotle,  Politics , Book 3, Section 1288a.  Tactfully, he included the young prince and his father in that category. Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and his attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be 'a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants'. Peter Green,  Alexander of Macedon , 1991 University of California Press, Ltd. Oxford, England. Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data, p.58–59 By 335 BC he had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the  Lyceum . Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with   of Stageira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father,  Nicomachus . According to the  , he also had an  ,  Palaephatus of Abydus . William George Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology , vol. 3,  p. 88 It is during this period in Athens from 335 to 323 BC when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.  Aristotle wrote many dialogues, only fragments of which survived. The works that have survived are in   form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication, as they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include  Physics ,  Metaphysics ,  ,  Politics ,   (On the Soul)  and  Poetics . Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy,  , geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology. In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, economics, psychology, rhetoric and theology. He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry. His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge. It has been suggested that Aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time. Near the end of Alexander's life, Alexander began to suspect plots against himself, and threatened Aristotle in letters. Aristotle had made no secret of his contempt for Alexander's pretense of divinity, and the king had executed Aristotle's grandnephew   as a traitor. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but there is little evidence for this. Peter Green,  Alexander of Macedon , 1991 University of California Press, Ltd. Oxford, England. Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data, p.379,459 Upon Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens once again flared.   denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor. Aristotle fled the city to his mother's family estate in  , explaining, "I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy," Vita Marciana  41, cf.

He died in Euboea of   within the year (in 322 BC). Aristotle named chief executor his student   and left a  will  in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.

 With the  , Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of  , and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in  .   stated in the  Critique of Pure Reason  that Aristotle's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of  . 
Aristotle "says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'".  However, Plato reports that   was devised before him, by  , who was concerned by the correct use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from  ; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like   in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a  , he could never actually construct one and relied instead on his  . Bocheński, 1951.  Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from  s, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the  conclusion  would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book  Sophist , where he introduced his division method. 
 
What we today call  Aristotelian logic , Aristotle himself would have labeled "analytics". The term "logic" he reserved to mean  dialectics . Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century AD:
 ''Categories'' ''On Interpretation'' ''Prior Analytics'' ''Posterior Analytics'' ''Topics'' ''On Sophistical Refutations'' 
The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the  Categories,  the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in  On Interpretation , to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the  Analytics ) and dialectics (in the  Topics  and  Sophistical Refutations ). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory  stricto sensu : the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the  Organon , namely the fourth book of  Metaphysics.

 thumb "Aristotle" by Francesco Hayez (1791–1882) Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the  universal . Aristotle, however, found the universal in   things, which he called the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their   or  . For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal  Forms  (or ideas) to a contemplation of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, "form" still refers to the unconditional basis of   but is "instantiated" in a particular substance (see  Universals and particulars , below). In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both  inductive  and  deductive , while Plato's is essentially deductive from  a priori  principles. In Aristotle's terminology, "natural philosophy" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. In modern times, the scope of  philosophy  has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the  . In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as "science". Note, however, that his use of the term  science  carries a different meaning than that covered by the term "scientific method". For Aristotle, "all science ( dianoia ) is either practical, poetical or theoretical" ( Metaphysics  1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics,   and metaphysics. If logic (or "analytics") is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1)  ; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy. In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform   in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences. Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers. His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his   he claimed that human males have more teeth than females. Aristotle,  History of Animals , 2.3.  In a similar vein,  , and later  Galileo , showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.  On the other hand, Aristotle refuted  's claim that the   was made up of "those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays," pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given "current astronomical demonstrations" that "the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then...the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them." Aristotle,  Meteorology  1.8, trans. E.W. Webster, rev. J. Barnes. In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched  . Today's scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws. Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the  Metaphysics , which was widely accepted up until the 16th century. From the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the Earth was the center of the universe ( ). Since he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch. Burent, John.  1928.  Platonism , Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 61, 103–104.  However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants. 
As quoted from  Charles Lyell's   :
 
 He  [Aristotle ] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages. He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized. He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the Palus Maeotis within sixty years from his own time... He alludes ...to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption. The changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten. He says  [12th chapter of his  Meteorics ] 'the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea, and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system, and within a certain period.' The concluding observation is as follows: 'As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed for ever. The places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time. So also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not some always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course of time.' Charles Lyell ,  Principles of Geology , 1832, p.17 
 
 
 
Aristotle proposed a fifth element, aether, in addition to the four proposed earlier by  .
 Earth , which is cold and dry; this corresponds to the modern idea of a  . Water , which is cold and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a  . Air , which is hot and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a  . Fire , which is hot and dry; this corresponds to the modern idea of  . Aether , which is the divine substance that makes up the  heavenly spheres  and heavenly bodies (stars and planets). 
Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place. All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe, i.e. the center of the Earth. Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center. Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere. Fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the Moon orbits). When elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it. This is "natural motion"—motion requiring no extrinsic cause. So, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises.  Outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles. 
 Aristotle defined  motion  as the actuality of a potentiality  as such . Physics  201a10-11, 201a27-29, 201b4-5  Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential, as a transition toward a potentially possible state. Because  actuality and potentiality  are normally opposites in Aristotle, other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous, or that the addition of the "as such" to the definition is critical to understanding it. 
 
Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors:
  describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. It is not about action. It does not mean one domino knocks over another domino. The   is its form, i.e. the arrangement of that matter.  It tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A more simple example of the formal cause is the blueprint or plan that one has before making or causing a human made object to exist. The   is "the primary source", or that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of "cause" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. More simply again that which immediately sets the thing in motion. So take the two dominos this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over. This is effectively efficient cause. The   is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is. This also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition, need, motivation or motives, rational, irrational, ethical, and all that gives purpose to behavior. 
Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event (not necessarily a mental goal). Taking our two dominos, it requires someone to intentionally knock the dominos over as they cannot fall themselves. Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect. 
Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. The earliest known written evidence of a   can be found in Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350 BC in  Problemata . Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or  , to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. In modern cameras, this is analogous to the  diaphragm . Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified. 
According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of  accidental things . It is "from what is spontaneous" (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of "chance" it might be better to think of "coincidence": Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance. There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names "luck", that can only apply to human beings, since it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. "What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance".

Aristotle defines metaphysics as "the knowledge of  immaterial  being," or of "being in the highest degree of  ." He refers to metaphysics as "first philosophy", as well as "the theologic science." 
 
Aristotle examines the concepts of  substance  and   ( ousia ) in his  Metaphysics  (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. As he proceeds to the book VIII, he concludes that the matter of the substance is the  substratum  or the stuff of which it is composed;  e.g. , the matter of the house are the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the  potential  house, while the form of the substance is the  actual  house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other  differentia  (see also  ). The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form. Aristotle,  Metaphysics  VIII 1043a 10–30 With regard to the change ( kinesis ) and its causes now, as he defines in his  Physics  and   319b-320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:
  growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;  locomotion, which is change in space; and  alteration, which is change in quality. 
The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality ( dynamis ) and actuality ( ) in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially ( dynamei ) plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' ( ) or 'be acted upon' ( ), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting). Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end ( telos ) is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.
 
"For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see." Aristotle,  Metaphysics  IX 1050a 5–10 
 
In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a   or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this   of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, "what is it that makes a man one"? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing. Aristotle,  Metaphysics  VIII 1045a-b 
 Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but "good" is still a proper universal form.   is a contemporary philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of "uninstantiated universals". Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms. 
In Aristotelian science, most especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.

Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of  , and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, such as  ,  , and  , contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on  ,  electric fish  ( Torpedo ) and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on  s, namely,  ,  Sepia  ( ) and the paper nautilus ( ). His description of the  hectocotyl arm  was about two thousand years ahead of its time, and widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē ( ). Singer, Charles.  A short history of biology . Oxford 1931. Another good example of his methods comes from the  Generation of Animals  in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated. He gave accurate descriptions of  s' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the  ovoviviparous  embryological development of the    .

Aristotle's classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the 19th century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he was not to know that complex invertebrates do make use of  , but of a different kind from vertebrates). Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (humans and mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of  , who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms). For  , "Nothing is more remarkable than  [Aristotle's ] efforts to  [exhibit ] the relationships of living things as a  scala naturae "  Aristotle's  History of Animals  classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical " Ladder of Life " ( scala naturae ), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move. Aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics. Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e.,  s, guided all natural processes. Such a   view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that "no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns," and "a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen," Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance. Mason,  A History of the Sciences  pp 43–44 In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the  scala naturae  or  . Mayr,  The Growth of Biological Thought , pp 201–202; see also: Lovejoy,  The Great Chain of Being  His system had eleven grades, arranged according "to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality", expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times. He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection. Aristotle,  De Anima  II 3 Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain. Mason,  A History of the Sciences  pp 45  Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of  Alcmaeon .

Aristotle's successor at the  Lyceum ,  , wrote a series of books on botany—the  History of Plants —which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the  . Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as  carpos  for fruit, and  pericarpion  for seed vessel. Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the  . Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.

After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. Annas,  Classical Greek Philosophy  pp 252  It is not until the age of   under the  Ptolemies  that advances in biology can be again found.

Aristotle's  , given in his treatise   ( peri psyche , often known by its   title  De Anima ), posits three  s ("psyches") in humans: the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans share the vegetative soul with all living things, and the sensitive soul with all animals, but only humans of all beings in the world have a rational soul. For Aristotle, the soul ( psyche ) was a simpler concept than it is for us today. By soul he simply meant the  form  of a living being. Since all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, article  "Psychology" . 
 
 Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the  . Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ( ergon ) of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the  psuchē  (normally translated as  soul ) in accordance with reason ( ). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action,  , generally translated as "happiness" or sometimes "well being". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ( ēthikē   ), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).  Book I. See for example chapter 7  1098a . Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom ( ) and their intellect ( ) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished  theoretical  or speculative thinker, or in other words, a  philosopher .  Book VI. 
 
   In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled  Politics . Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the   which in turn is prior to the individual, "for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part". Politics 1253a19-24  He also famously stated that "man is by nature a political animal." Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an   rather than like a  , and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner. The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different to Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city ( ) which functions as a political "community" or "partnership" ( koinōnia ) . The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability , but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: "The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together ." This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with   theory, according to which individuals leave the   because of "fear of violent death" or its "inconveniences."

Aristotle considered  , tragedy, comedy,  dithyrambic poetry  and music to be  imitative , each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. Aristotle,  Poetics  I 1447a  For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama. Aristotle,  Poetics  III  Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals. Aristotle,  Poetics  IV While it is believed that Aristotle's  Poetics  comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, spectacle, and lyric poetry. Aristotle,  Poetics  VI  The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the   of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes  Poetics  with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic  . He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.

Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. On these grounds, Aristotle is considered by some feminist critics to have been a  misogynist . 
On the other hand, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his Rhetoric that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too: In places like Sparta where the lot of women is bad, there can only be half-happiness in society. Rhetoric  1.5.6 
 
Modern scholarship reveals that Aristotle's "lost" works stray considerably in characterization Terence Irwin and Gail Fine,  ,  Aristotle: Introductory Readings.  Indianapolis, Indiana: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc. (1996), Introduction, pp. xi–xii.  from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication, the surviving works do not appear to have been so.  Rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication.  The authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally Aristotelian is also today held suspect, with some books duplicating or summarizing each other, the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely Aristotle's at all. Some of the individual works within the corpus, including the  ,  are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle's "school," perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision. Others, such as  On Colors,  may have been produced by Aristotle's successors at the Lyceum, e.g.,   and  Straton . Still others acquired Aristotle's name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the  De Plantis,  possibly by  . Other works in the corpus include medieval   and   and   texts whose connections to Aristotle are purely fanciful and self-promotional. Lynn Thorndike, "Chiromancy in Medieval Latin Manuscripts,"  Speculum  40 (1965), pp. 674–706; Roger A. Pack, "Pseudo-Arisoteles: Chiromantia,"  Archives d’histoire doctrinale et littéraire du Moyen Âge  39 (1972), pp. 289–320; Pack, "A Pseudo-Aristotelian Chiromancy,"  Archives d’histoire doctrinale et littéraire du Moyen Âge  36 (1969), pp. 189–241. According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the " " and the " ". , "Life and Work" in  The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle  (1995), p. 12; Aristotle himself:  Nicomachean Ethics  1102a26–27. Aristotle himself never uses the term "esoteric" or "acroamatic". For other passages where Aristotle speaks of  exōterikoi logoi , see  ,  Aristotle's Metaphysics  (1953), vol. 2, pp. 408–410. Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to "discussions not peculiar to the  ", rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own.  Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works intended for use within the school (esoteric). Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle’s own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students). Barnes, "Life and Work", p. 12.  However, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation.  The 5th century     writes that Aristotle's writing style is deliberately  obscurantist  so that “good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these.”  p. 15 
Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. ( Fragments  of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that   refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as "a river of gold";  it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us.  However, some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that Cicero's praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works; a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in Aristotle's extant works. Barnes, "Roman Aristotle", in Gregory Nagy,  Greek Literature , Routledge 2001, vol. 8, p. 174 n. 240. The surviving texts of Aristotle are technical treatises from within Aristotle's school, as opposed to the  dialogues and other "exoteric" texts  he published more widely during his lifetime. In some cases, the Aristotelian texts were likely left in different versions and contexts (as in the overlapping parts of the  Eudemian Ethics  and  Nicomachean Ethics ), or in smaller units that could be incorporated into larger books in different ways. Because of this, a posthumous compiler and publisher may sometimes have played a significant role in arranging the text into the form we know. One major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us? The definitive, English study of these questions is Barnes, "Roman Aristotle".  The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by   in his  Geography  and   in his  . "Sulla."  The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to  . Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to  , where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when   discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When   occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to  , where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian   and then by philosopher  . Ancient Rome: from the early Republic to the assassination of Julius Caesar – Page 513, Matthew Dillon, Lynda Garland The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 22 – Page 131, Grolier Incorporated – Juvenile Nonfiction  attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides "the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C."  Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair. Second, there is "incontrovertible evidence," Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelian interpolations in the  Politics , for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact. As the influence of the   grew in the West, in part due to  's translations and the spread of  , the demand for Aristotle's works grew.    translated a number of them into Latin. When   wrote his  , working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the  Greek  manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in   to the point where   philosophy could be equated with Aristotelianism.

More than twenty-three hundred years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher  , "it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did".  Aristotle was the founder of  , W. K. C. Guthrie (1990).

Despite these achievements, the influence of Aristotle's errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably.   notes that "almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine". Russell also refers to Aristotle's ethics as "repulsive", and calls his logic "as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy". Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors. 
The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the  . Aristotle's notable students included  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  Nicomachus , and  . Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained "Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?"

In accordance with the  Greek  theorists, the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that Aristotle shared with   essential tenets of thought.

Aristotle is referred to as "The Philosopher" by  Scholastic  thinkers such as  . See  , Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods.

: Amid the philosophic family,

: There Plato too I saw, and Socrates, 
: Who stood beside him closer than the rest. vidi ’l maestro di color che sanno

The German philosopher   has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle. Durant, p. 86  However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separation of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue – or  arete  – of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy. It is  , not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.   accredited Aristotle as "the greatest philosopher in history" and cited him as a major influence on her thinking. More recently,   has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.

The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school. Reference to them is made according to the organization of  's Royal Prussian Academy edition ( Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica , Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.

 <Abraham Lincoln> 
 
 
 Abraham Lincoln    (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the  16th President of the United States , serving from March 1861 until  his assassination in April 1865 . He successfully led his country through a great constitutional, military and moral crisis – the   – preserving the Union, while ending slavery, and promoting economic and financial modernization. Reared in a poor family on the western frontier, Lincoln was mostly self-educated. He became a country lawyer, a  Whig Party   Illinois state legislator , and a one-term member of the  , but failed in two attempts to be elected to the   as a  new Republican Party . After opposing the expansion of   in his campaign debates and speeches, Goodwin, p. 91; Holzer, p. 232.  Lincoln secured the Republican nomination and was  elected president in 1860 . Before Lincoln took office in March, seven  southern slave states  declared their  secession  and formed the Confederacy. When war began with the Confederate attack on   on April 12, 1861, Lincoln concentrated on both the military and political dimensions of the war effort, seeking to reunify the nation. He vigorously exercised unprecedented war powers, including the arrest and detention without trial of thousands of suspected secessionists. He prevented British recognition of the  Confederacy  by skillfully handling the  ''Trent'' affair  late in 1861.  His efforts toward the  abolition  of slavery include issuing his   in 1863 and encouraging Congress to propose what would become the  Thirteenth Amendment  to the United States Constitution. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including commanding general  . He brought leaders of various factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate. Under his leadership, the  Union  set up a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade, took control of the  border slave states  at the start of the war, gained control of communications with gunboats on the southern river systems, and tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at  Richmond . Each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865. An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, he reached out to   and managed his own re-election in the  1864 presidential election . As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, Lincoln found his policies and personality were "blasted from all sides":   demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats desired more compromise,  Copperheads  despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists plotted his death. Tagg, p. xiii.  Politically, Lincoln fought back with patronage, by pitting his opponents against each other, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory. Randall (1947), pp. 65–87.  His   of 1863 became the most quoted speech in American history. Bulla (2010), p. 222.  It was an iconic statement of America's dedication to the principles of nationalism,  republicanism , equal rights, liberty, and democracy. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of  Reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. But six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general  , Lincoln was  assassinated  by Confederate sympathizer  .  His death was the first assassination of a U.S. president and sent the nation  into  mourning . Lincoln has been consistently  ranked  by scholars and the public as one of the three greatest U.S. presidents. "Ranking Our Presidents" . James Lindgren. November 16, 2000. International World History Project. "Americans Say Reagan Is the Greatest President" . Gallup Inc. February 28, 2011. 
 
 
Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, the second child of   and   (née Hanks), in a one-room log cabin on the   in  Hardin County , Kentucky, Donald (1996), pp. 20–22.  (now  LaRue County ).  Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake,  Abraham , had moved his family from Virginia to  Jefferson County , Kentucky, Pessen, pp. 24–25.  where he was ambushed and killed in an Indian raid in 1786, with his children, including Lincoln's father Thomas, looking on. White, pp. 12–13.   Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier. Donald (1996), p. 21.   Lincoln's mother, Nancy, was the daughter of Lucy Hanks, and was born in what is now  Mineral County , West Virginia, then part of Virginia. Lucy moved with Nancy to Kentucky. Nancy Hanks married Thomas, who became a respected citizen. He bought and sold several farms, including the Sinking Spring Farm. The family attended a   church, which had high moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery. Donald (1996), pp. 22–24.  Thomas enjoyed considerable status in Kentucky—where he sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. By the time his son Abraham was born, Thomas owned two   farms, several town lots, livestock, and horses. He was among the richest men in the county. Lamb, p. 189.  However, in 1816, Thomas lost all of his land in court cases because of faulty  property titles . thumb left The young Lincoln in sculpture at Senn Park, Chicago A statue of young Lincoln sitting on a stump, holding a book open on his lap The family moved north across the Ohio River to free (i.e., non-slave) territory and made a new start in  Perry County , Indiana.  Lincoln later noted that this move was "partly on account of slavery" but mainly due to land title difficulties. Sandburg (1926), p. 20.  In Indiana, when Lincoln was nine, his mother Nancy died of   in 1818.   After the death of Lincoln's mother, his older sister,  Sarah , took charge of caring for him until their father remarried in 1819; Sarah later died in her 20s while giving birth to a stillborn son. Donald (1996), p. 20. Thomas Lincoln's new wife was the widow  Sarah Bush Johnston , the mother of three of her own children. Lincoln became very close to his stepmother, and referred to her as "Mother". Donald (1996), pp. 26–27.   As a pre-teen, he did not like the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some in his family, and in the neighborhood, for a time considered him to be lazy. White, pp. 25, 31, 47. Donald (1996), p. 33.  As he grew into his teens, he willingly took responsibility for all chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household and became an adept axeman in his work building rail fences. He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match to which he was challenged by the renowned leader of a group of ruffians, "the Clary's Grove boys". Donald (1996), p. 41.   Lincoln also agreed with the customary obligation of a son to give his father all earnings from work done outside the home until age 21. Donald (1996), pp. 30–33.  In later years, Lincoln occasionally loaned his father money. Donald (1996), pp. 28, 152.  Lincoln became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his father's lack of education.  While young Lincoln's formal elementary education consisted approximately of a year's worth of classes from several itinerant teachers, he was mostly self-educated and was an avid reader. Donald (1996), pp. 38–43; Prokopowicz, pp. 18–19. In 1830, fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River, the Lincoln family moved west, where they settled on public land in  Macon County , Illinois, another free, non-slave state. Donald (1996), p. 36.  In 1831, Thomas relocated the family to a  new homestead  in  Coles County , Illinois. It was then that, as an ambitious 22-year-old, Lincoln decided to seek a better life and struck out on his own.  Canoeing down the  , Lincoln ended up in the village of  New Salem  in  Sangamon County . Thomas (2008), pp. 23–53; Carwardine (2003), pp. 3–5.  In the spring of 1831, hired by New Salem businessman   and accompanied by friends, he took goods by   from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers. After arriving in New Orleans—and witnessing slavery firsthand—he walked back home. Sandburg (1926), pp. 22–23. 
 
 Lincoln's first romantic interest was  , whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. She died on August 25, most likely of  . Donald (1996), pp. 55–58.  In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister. Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship was over. Donald (1996), pp. 67–69; Thomas (2008), pp. 56–57, 69–70. In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to  Mary Todd , who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in  Lexington , Kentucky. Lamb, p. 43.  They met in  Springfield , Illinois, in December 1839 Sandburg (1926), pp. 46–48.  and were engaged the following December. Donald (1996), p. 86. 
A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative. Donald (1996), p. 87.  They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister. Sandburg (1926), pp. 50–51. 
While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, "To hell, I suppose." Donald (1996), p. 93. In 1844, the couple bought a house in Springfield near Lincoln's law office. White, p. 125.  Mary Todd Lincoln worked diligently in their home, assuming full household duties which had previously been performed for her by slaves at her home in Kentucky. She efficiently used the limited income available from her husband's law practice. Donald (1996), pp. 95–96.    was born in 1843 and   (Eddie) in 1846. Lincoln "was remarkably fond of children", White, p. 126.  and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children. Baker, p. 120.  Robert was the only child to live to adulthood. Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, likely of  .   "Willie" Lincoln  was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862. The Lincolns' fourth son,  Thomas "Tad" Lincoln , was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871. White, pp. 179–181, 476. The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875. Steers, p. 341.  Abraham Lincoln suffered from " ", a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression. Lincoln's father-in-law was based in Lexington, Kentucky; he and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington. Foner (1995), pp. 440–447.  He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children. 
 In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in  New Salem , Illinois. Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the  . He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. Winkle ch 7–8. thumb left 150px upright Thin man looking to the right wearing a bow tie. A sketch of candidate Abraham Lincoln Before the election Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the  . Winkle, pp. 86–95.  Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly.  At  , Sandburg (2002), p. 14  he was tall and "strong enough to intimidate any rival". At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his "neck and the seat of his trousers" and threw him. Donald (1996), p. 46.  Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct. Winkle, pp. 114–116. Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously. He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading  Blackstone 's   and other law books. Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: "I studied with nobody". Donald (1996), pp. 53–55.   His second campaign in 1834 was successful. He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a  Whig , many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent. White, p. 59.    Admitted to the bar  in 1836, Donald (1996), p. 64.  he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under  , Mary Todd's cousin. White, pp. 71, 79, 108.  Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered with   from 1841 until 1844, when he began his practice with  William Herndon , whom Lincoln thought "a studious young man". Donald (1948), p. 17.  He served four successive terms in the   as a Whig representative from Sangamon County. Simon, p. 283. In the 1835–1836 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners or not. Simon, p. 130.  He was known for his "free soil" stance of opposing both slavery and  . He first articulated this in 1837, saying, "Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils." Donald (1996), p. 134.  He closely followed   in supporting the   program of making the abolition of slavery practical by helping the freed slaves to settle in   in Africa. Foner (2010), pp. 17–19, 67. 
 
From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast  Whig  and professed to friends in 1861 to be, "an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay". Donald (1996), p. 222.  The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund   including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well. Boritt (1994), pp. 137–153. In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served one two-year term.  He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line. Oates, p. 79.  Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman  , wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters. Harris, p. 54; Foner (2010), p. 57.  On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the  , which he attributed to  President Polk 's desire for "military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood". Heidler (2006), pp. 181–183.  Lincoln also supported the  , which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico. Holzer, p. 63. Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his  . The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the US; Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had "invaded  our territory  and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our  own soil ". Oates, pp. 79–80. Basler (1946), pp. 199–202.  Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.  Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him "spotty Lincoln". McGovern, p. 33. Basler (1946), p. 202.  Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers. Donald (1996), p. 128. Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General   for the Whig nomination in the  1848 presidential election . Donald (1996), pp. 124–126.  Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the  , but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival, Justin Butterfield, considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer, but in Lincoln's view, an "old fossil". Donald (1996), p. 140.  The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the  . This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice. Harris, pp. 55–57. 
 thumb right upright Middle aged clean shaven Lincoln from the hips up. Lincoln in his late 30s – photo taken by one of Lincoln's law students around 1846 Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling "every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer". Donald (1996), p. 96.  Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. Donald (1996), pp. 105–106, 158.  Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. Donald (1996), pp. 142–143.  His reputation grew, and he appeared before the  , arguing a case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. Donald (1996), pp. 156–157.  In 1849, he received  a patent for a flotation device  for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent. White, p. 163. In 1851, he represented  Alton & Sangamon Railroad  in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route. Donald (1996), p. 155. Dirck (2007), p. 92.  Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter in existence at the time of Barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment. The decision by the  Illinois Supreme Court  has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation.  Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor. Handy, p. 440.  From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincoln's largest clients was the  . Donald (1996), pp. 155–156, 196–197. Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended  , who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. Donald (1996), pp. 150–151.  The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by   in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a   showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.  Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison. Harrison (1935), p. 270. 
 
 
By the 1850s, slavery was still legal in the southern United States, but had been generally outlawed in the northern states, such as Illinois.  Lincoln disapproved of slavery, and the spread of slavery to new U.S. territory in the west.  He returned to politics to oppose the pro-slavery   (1854); this law repealed the slavery-restricting   (1820). Senior Senator   of Illinois had incorporated  popular sovereignty  into the Act. Douglas' provision, which Lincoln opposed, specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U.S. territory, rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress. McGovern, pp. 36–37.  Foner (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the  republicanism principles  of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence. Foner (2010), pp. 84–88. Painting thumb 180px Portrait of  . Lincoln denounced the Supreme Court decision in ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' as a conspiracy. On October 16, 1854, in his " Peoria Speech ", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency. Thomas (2008), pp. 148–152.  Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice, White, p. 199.  he said the Kansas Act had a " declared  indifference, but as I must think, a covert  real  zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world..." Basler (1953), p. 255. In late 1854, Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. Oates, p. 119.  After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly, his support began to dwindle, and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for  , who defeated opponent  . White, pp. 205–208.  The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Lincoln wrote, "I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist, even though I do no more than oppose the  extension  of slavery."   Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party, and on disenchanted Free Soil, Liberty, and Democratic party members, he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new Republican Party. McGovern, pp. 38–39.  At the  , Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for vice president. Donald (1996), p. 193. In 1857–58, Douglas broke with President  , leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the  , which would have admitted Kansas as a  . Oates, pp. 138–139.  In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision in  ; Chief Justice   opined that blacks were not citizens, and derived no rights from the Constitution. Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power Zarefsky, pp. 69–110.  Lincoln argued, "The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'." Jaffa, pp. 299–300. After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U.S. Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his  House Divided Speech , drawing on  : "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other." White, p. 251.  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North. Harris, p. 98.  The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator. Donald (1996), p. 209.

Head shot of older, clean shaven Lincoln The 1858 senate campaign featured the seven  , the most famous political debates in American history. McPherson (1993), p. 182.  The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that " " was threatening the values of  republicanism , and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that  , while Douglas emphasized his  , that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. Donald (1996), pp. 214–224.  The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas's   theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the  Dred Scott  decision. Donald (1996), p. 223. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation. Carwardine (2003), pp. 89–90.  In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the  Illinois Staats-Anzeiger,  a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize. Donald (1996), pp. 242, 412. On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a  speech at Cooper Union  to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any "groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong". Jaffa, p. 473.  Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly Holzer, pp. 108–111. —Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination. Journalist   reported, "No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience." Carwardine (2003), p. 97. Holzer, p. 157.  Historian Donald described the speech as a "superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's ( ) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's ( ) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery." Donald (1996), p. 240.  In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, "The taste  is  in my mouth a little." Donald (1996), p. 241.

"The Rail Candidate"—Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is depicted as held up by the slavery issue—a slave on the left and party organization on the right. On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in  Decatur . Donald (1996), p. 244.  Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis,  Norman Judd ,  , and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency. Oates, pp. 175–176.  Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father, Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of "The Rail Candidate". Donald (1996), p. 245.  On May 18, at the  Republican National Convention  in Chicago, Lincoln's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. A former Democrat   of Maine was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff. Luthin, pp. 609–629.  On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top.  Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs. Hofstadter, pp. 50–55.  Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincoln's strong dictate to "Make no contracts that bind me". Donald (1996), pp. 247–250. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the  Dred Scott  decision and the presidency of James Buchanan.  Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. Boritt (1994), pp. 10, 13, 18.  Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, with   as the vice-presidential candidate. Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the  Democratic convention , disagreeing with Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected   as their candidate. Donald (1996), p. 253. As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials.  There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of "free labor", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. Donald (1996), pp. 254–256.  The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a  Chicago Tribune  writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies. Donald (1996), p. 254. 
 
 
 
On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and  John Bell  of the new  Constitutional Union Party . He was the first president from the Republican Party. Winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North and West, no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states. Mansch, p. 61.  Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, Douglas 1,376,957 votes, Breckinridge 849,781 votes, and Bell 588,789 votes. Turnout was 82.2 percent, with Lincoln winning the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. Douglas won Missouri, and split New Jersey with Lincoln. Harris, p. 243.  Bell won Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and Breckinridge won the rest of the South. White, p. 350.  Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote, his victory in the  electoral college  was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were  fusion tickets  in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College. Nevins,  Ordeal of the Union  vol 4. p. 312. As Lincoln's election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March. Edgar, p. 350.  On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed. Potter, p. 498.  Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the  . Donald (1996), p. 267.

The   would have extended the   line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, contrary to the Republican Party's free-soil platform. White, pp. 360–361.  Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, "I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right." Donald (1996), p. 268.  Lincoln, however, did support the   to the Constitution, which had passed in Congress and protected slavery in those states where it already existed. Vorenberg, p. 22.  A few weeks before the war, he went so far as to pen a letter to every governor asking for their support in ratifying the Corwin Amendment as a means to avoid secession. Lupton, p. 34. En route to his inauguration by train, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North. Donald (1996), pp. 273–277.  The president-elect then  evaded possible assassins  in Baltimore, who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security,  . On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard. Donald (1996), pp. 277–279.  Lincoln directed his  inaugural address  to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states:
 
The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies ... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature." Donald (1996), pp. 283–284.  The failure of the   signaled that legislative compromise was implausible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated. Donald (1996), pp. 268, 279. 
 
 portrait thumb 170px Major Anderson, Ft. Sumter commander 
The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina,  Major Robert Anderson  sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war.  On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at  Fort Sumter , forcing them to surrender, and began the war.  Historian   argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion. Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union  (1959) vol 5 p 29     talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was "sadly disappointed" at his failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and that the South was preparing for war. Sherman, pp. 185–186.  Donald concludes that, "His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that." Donald (1996), p. 293. On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and "preserve the Union", which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of  Richmond  so close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral. Oates, p. 226. Troops headed south towards Washington to protect the capital in response to Lincoln's call. On April 19, secessionist mobs in Baltimore that controlled the rail links  attacked Union troops  traveling to the capital.  , the Mayor of Baltimore, and other suspect Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned, without a warrant, as Lincoln suspended the writ of  habeas corpus . Heidler (2000), p. 174.   , a leader in the secessionist group in Maryland, petitioned Chief Justice   to issue a writ of habeas corpus, saying holding Merryman without a hearing was unlawful. Taney issued the writ, thereby ordering Merryman's release, but Lincoln ignored it.  Then and throughout the war, Lincoln came under heavy, often vituperative attack from antiwar Democrats, called  . Scott, pp. 326–341. After the fall of  Fort Sumter , Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion.  Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as  , using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending  habeas corpus , arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.

"Running the 'Machine'&nbsp;": An 1864 political cartoon takes a swing at Lincoln's administration—featuring William Fessenden, Edwin Stanton, William Seward, Gideon Welles, Lincoln and others. The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Donald (1996), pp. 315, 331–333, 338–339, 417.  On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the  Confiscation Act  that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy Donald (1996), p. 314; Carwardine (2003), p. 178. In late August 1861, General  , the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting Washington, a proclamation of martial law in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the   compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. Donald (1996), pp. 314–317.  Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops. Carwardine (2003), p. 181. The   of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship the  Trent  on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain. Adams, pp. 540–562.   Lincoln's foreign policy approach had been initially hands off, due to his inexperience; he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. Seward's initial reaction to the  Trent  affair, however, was too bellicose, so Lincoln also turned to Senator  , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an expert in British diplomacy. Donald (1996), p. 322. To learn technical military terms, Lincoln borrowed and studied  's book,  Elements of Military Art and Science  from the Library of Congress. Prokopowicz, p. 127.  Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming in to the War Department in Washington, D.C. He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced   with   as War Secretary. Stanton was one of many conservative Democrats (he supported Breckenridge in the 1860 election) who became anti-slavery Republicans under Lincoln's leadership. Benjamin P. Thomas and Harold M. Hyman,  Stanton, the Life and Times of Lincoln's Secretary of War  (Knopf, 1962)  In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Donald (1996), pp. 295–296.  Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Donald (1996), pp. 391–392.  Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General  Henry Halleck , a student of the European strategist  Jomini , of the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River; Ambrose, pp. 7, 66, 159.  he also knew well the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory. Donald (1996), pp. 432–436. 
After the Union defeat at the   and the retirement of the aged   in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General   general-in-chief of all the Union armies. Donald (1996), pp. 318–319.  McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign, longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign. Donald (1996), pp. 349–352. Photograph of Lincoln and McClellan sitting at a table in a field tent thumb 275px Lincoln and McClellan after the Battle of Antietam Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief and appointed   in March 1862, after McClellan's "Harrison's Landing Letter", in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. Donald (1996), pp. 360–361.  McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint  John Pope , a Republican, as head of the new  . Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the   in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. Nevins (1960), pp. 2:159–162.  The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS  Virginia , formerly the USS  Merrimack , damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the USS  Monitor . Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the  . Donald (1996), pp. 339–340. Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward. Goodwin, pp. 478–479.  Two days after McClellan's return to command, General  's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the   in September 1862. Goodwin, pp. 478–480.  The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January.  Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation. Goodwin, p. 481.  McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General   likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with  ; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican  . Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief. Donald (1996), pp. 389–390. Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the   and was stunningly defeated by Lee at  Fredericksburg  in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Donald (1996), pp. 429–431.  Lincoln brought in  , despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship. Nevins 6:433-44 The  mid-term elections  in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus,  the military draft law , and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest. While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati  Gazette  contended that the voters were "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress". Nevins vol 6 pp. 318–322, quote on p. 322. In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston. Donald (1996), pp. 422–423. Hooker was routed by Lee at the   in May, Nevins 6:432–450.  but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harper's Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by  , who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the  , which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor. Donald (1996), pp. 444–447. 
After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander in Chief. Donald (1996), p. 446.

Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept   in return for their prohibition of slavery (an offer that took effect only in Washington, D.C., in April 1862). Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the  Founding Fathers , under the constitution.  President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General   in August 1861 and by Major General   in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union. Guelzo (1999), pp. 290–291. On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July 1862, the Second  Confiscation Act  was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the commander-in-chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that "as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free." Donald (1996), pp. 364–365. Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the war could not be won without freeing the slaves. However Confederate and anti-war propagandists had success spreading the theme that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor   of the highly influential  New York Tribune  fell for the ploy. McPherson (1992), p. 124.  and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862. The President said the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his "official duty") was preserving the Union: Guelzo (2004), pp. 147–153. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Donald (1996), pp. 364, 379.  Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until over three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper." Donald (1996), p. 407.  For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up  colonies  for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. Donald (1996), p. 408.  A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the  ; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army. Nevins (1960), pp. 2:239–240. Using former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. At first, Lincoln was reluctant to fully implement this program, but by the spring of 1863, he was ready to initiate "a massive recruitment of Negro troops". In a letter to Andrew Johnson, the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, "The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once". Donald (1996), pp. 430–431.  By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley. Donald (1996), p. 431.    once observed of Lincoln: "In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color". Douglass, pp. 259–260. 
 
With the great Union victory at the   in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the  . The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery. Donald (1996), pp. 453–460.  Defying Lincoln's prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here," the Address became the most quoted speech in American history. The Gettysburg Address was delivered at the dedication of the  Soldiers' National Cemetery  in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863. In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."   He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort.  He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy would be assured, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation. Donald (1996), pp. 460–466. Wills, pp. 20, 27, 105, 146. 
 Painting of four men conferring in a ship's cabin, entitled "The Peacemakers". thumb 300px President Lincoln (center right) with, from left, Generals Sherman, Grant and Admiral Porter – 1868 painting of events aboard the '' River Queen '' in March, 1865 Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General  's victories at the   and in the   impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, "I can't spare this man. He fights." Thomas (2008), p. 315.  With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops. Nevins (2000), (Vol. IV), pp. 6–17. Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington. Donald (1996), pp. 490–492. Grant waged his bloody   in 1864. This is often characterized as a  war of attrition , given high Union losses at battles such as the   and  Cold Harbor . Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had "almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces". McPherson (2009), p. 113.  The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer." Donald (1996), p. 501. The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every battle, forcing it back to trenches outside Petersburg, Virginia, where Grant began a siege. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and   about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina.  Lincoln and the Republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced his losses. Thomas (2008), pp. 422–424. Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and   to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's  . The damage caused by   through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a   swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. As Neely (2004) concludes, there was no effort to engage in "total war" against civilians, as in World War II. Neely (2004), pp. 434–458. Confederate general   began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During his  raid on Washington, D.C.  in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain  Oliver Wendell Holmes  shouted at him, "Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!" Thomas (2008), p. 434.  After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched. Donald (1996), pp. 516–518. As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President  Stephens  led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at  . Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. Donald (1996), p. 565.  On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the   and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but   greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at  Appomattox  and the war was effectively over. Donald (1996), p. 589. 
 
Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in   such as   and   as well.  Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. Fish, pp. 53–69. Tegeder, pp. 77–90.  At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected  , a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new  Union Party . Donald (1996), pp. 494–507. When Grant's spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House: Grimsley, p. 80. 
  Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope. While the Democratic platform followed the  Peace wing  of the party and called the war a "failure", their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and  David Farragut's  capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters; Donald (1996), p. 531.  the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads. Randall  &  Current (1955), p. 307.  Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote. Paludan, pp. 274–293. On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his  second inaugural address . In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will. Historian Mark Noll concludes it ranks "among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world". Noll, p. 426.  Lincoln said: 
 
Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, "Let 'em up easy." Thomas (2008), pp. 509–512.  In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep.  , Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen.  , political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His  Amnesty Proclamation  of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance. Donald (1996), pp. 471–472. Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union thumb 260px A political cartoon of Andrew Johnson and Abraham Lincoln, 1865, entitled "The Rail Splitter At Work Repairing the Union." The caption reads (Johnson): ''Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever.'' (Lincoln): ''A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.'' As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals   and   as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General   to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the  , in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee. Donald (1996), pp. 485–486. Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals,  , who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies. Nevins (2000), Vol IV., p. 206. After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would "clinch the whole matter". Donald (1996), p. 561.  By December 1863 a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery absolutely was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives.  Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 13, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification. Donald (1996), pp. 562–563.   Upon ratification, it became the  Thirteenth Amendment  to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865. As the war drew to a close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of  .  He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's   bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen.  Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction.  Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists. Carwardine (2003), pp. 242–243. 
 thumb upright left An older tired looking Lincoln with a beard. The last high-quality photograph of Lincoln was taken March 1865. The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term "the United States" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural ("these United States"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century. In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of  republican values . As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism. Jaffa, p. 399.  The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself." Diggins, p. 307.  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms. Foner (2010), p. 215.  Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. Jaffa, p. 263.  Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated. Orville Vernon Burton,  The Age of Lincoln  (2008) p 243   In March 1861, in his  First Inaugural Address , Lincoln explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said "A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people." Belz (1998), p. 86. 
 
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. Donald (2001), p. 137.  He signed the   in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The  , also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The   of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States'  , which was completed in 1869. Paludan, p. 116.  The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s. McPherson (1993), pp. 450–452. Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third  , the first having become law under James Buchanan. In 1861, Lincoln signed the  , creating the first U.S. income tax. Donald (1996), p. 424.  This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800, which was later changed by the   to a progressive rate structure. Paludan, p. 111. Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the   provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency. In 1862, Congress created, with Lincoln's approval, the  Department of Agriculture . Donald (2001), p. 424.  In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the " Sioux Uprising " in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted  Santee Dakota  who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved). Cox, p. 182.   President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy. Nichols, pp. 210–232. In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the  New York World  and the  Journal of Commerce  published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days. Donald (1996), pp. 501–502. Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the  Thanksgiving holiday  in the United States. Donald (1996), p. 471.  Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during  's presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.  In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as  . Schaffer, p. 48. 
Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that "we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known."  Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court.  , nominated January 21, 1862 and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union.  , nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist.  David Davis , Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862 and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit.  , a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863 and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary,  , was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party. Blue, p. 245. 
West Virginia, admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union. Nevada, which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted October 31, 1864. Lincoln recognized both of these state governments when formed locally, but was not otherwise involved prior to their admission by Congress. Donald (1996), pp. 300, 539.

In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) Donald (1996), p. 587.  to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners.  thumb left A drawing of Lincoln being shot by Booth while sitting in a theater booth. Shown in the presidential booth of Ford's Theatre, from left to right, are Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln, and his assassin John Wilkes Booth.   After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president. Harrison (2000), pp. 3–4.  Learning that the President, First Lady, and head Union general Ulysses S. Grant would be attending  , Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President  , Secretary of State   and General Grant. Without his main bodyguard,  , Lincoln left to attend the play   on April 14. Grant along with his wife chose at the last minute to travel to Philadelphia instead of attending the play. Donald (1996), pp. 594–597. Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during intermission to join Lincoln's coachman for drinks in the Star Saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, aimed at the back of Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major   momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped. Donald (1996), p. 597. After being on the run for 10 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some   south of Washington, D.C. After a brief fight with Union troops, Booth was killed by Sergeant   on April 26. Donald (1996), p. 599. An Army surgeon, Doctor  , assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. The dying man was taken across the street to  . After being in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. Presbyterian minister  , then present, was asked to offer a prayer, after which Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages." Donald (1996), pp. 598–599, 686. Witnesses have provided other versions of the quote, i.e. "He now belongs to the ages." and "He is a man for the ages." Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. Vice President Johnson was sworn in as President at 10:00 am the day after the assassination. Lincoln lay in state in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21.  For three weeks, his funeral train brought the body to cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands, as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands, bonfires and hymn singing. Trostel, pp. 31–58. Goodrich, pp. 231–238. 
 
 thumb 160px A painting of Lincoln sitting with his hand on his chin and his elbow on his leg. Lincoln: painting by   in 1869 Scholars have extensively written on topics concerning Lincoln's beliefs and philosophy; e.g. whether Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language reflected his own personal beliefs or was a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. Carwardine (1997), pp. 27–55.  Though he never joined a church, Lincoln was familiar with the Bible, quoted it and praised it. Donald (1996), pp. 48–49, 514–515. In the 1840s Lincoln subscribed to the  Doctrine of Necessity , a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power. Donald (1996), pp. 48–49.   In the 1850s, Lincoln acknowledged "providence" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. Grant R. Brodrecht,  "Our country": Northern evangelicals and the Union during the Civil War and Reconstruction  (2008) p. 40  When he suffered the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently acknowledged his own need to depend on God. Parrillo, pp. 227–253.  The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. Wilson, pp. 251–254.  After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds." Wilson, p. 254. 
In  surveys of scholars ranking Presidents  since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often #1.  A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington. Taranto, p. 264.   Of all the presidential ranking polls conducted since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls: Schlesinger 1948, Schlesinger 1962, 1982 Murray Blessing Survey,  Chicago Tribune  1982 poll, Schlesinger 1996, CSPAN 1996, Ridings-McIver 1996,  Time  2008, and CSPAN 2009. Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1) Lincoln; 2) George Washington; and 3) Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, occasionally are reversed. Densen, John V., Editor,  Reassessing The Presidency, The Rise of the Executive State and the Decline of Freedom  (Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2001), pgs. 1-32; Ridings, William H.,  &  Stuard B. McIver,  Rating The Presidents, A Ranking of U.S. Leaders, From the Great and Honorable to the Dishonest and Incompetent  (Citadel Press, Kensington Publishing Corp., 2000). President Lincoln's assassination made him a national martyr and endowed him with a recognition of mythic proportion.  Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability. Chesebrough, pp. 76, 79, 106, 110. Exterior photograph of museum thumb left The   focuses on Lincoln scholarship and popular interpretation Schwartz argues that Lincoln's reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall in Washington. Schwartz (2000), p. 109.   In the   era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state. In the   years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes. Schwartz (2009), pp. 23, 91–98. By the 1970s Lincoln had became a hero to  political conservatives Havers, p. 96. Apart from neo-Confederates such as   who denounced his treatment of the white South.  for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of un-freedom (slavery), his acting in terms of Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers. Belz (2006), pp. 514–518. Graebner, pp. 67–94. Smith, pp. 43–45.  As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, internal improvements, and railroads in opposition to the  agrarian Democrats . Boritt (1994), pp. 196, 198, 228, 301.  William C. Harris found that Lincoln's "reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism.". Harris, p. 2.   James G. Randall  emphasizes his tolerance and his especially his moderation "in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform." Randall concludes that, "he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders." Randall (1947), p. 175. By the late 1960s, liberals, such as historian  Lerone Bennett , were having second thoughts, especially regarding Lincoln's views on racial issues. Zilversmit, pp. 22–24. Smith, p. 42.   Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. Bennett, pp. 35–42.  He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs, told jokes that ridiculed blacks, insisted he opposed social equality, and proposed  sending freed slaves  to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians; Dirck (2008), p. 31.  and that he was a "moral visionary" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. Striner, pp. 2–4.   The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation. Cashin, p. 61. Kelley  &  Lewis, p. 228.   Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered "erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule," in the late 20th century. Schwartz (2009), p. 146.  On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of  , defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason."

 thumb ''The Wrath of Achilles'', by   (1821–1859) ( ) 
In  ,  Achilles  ( ,  Akhilleus ,  ) was a  Greek  hero of the  , the central character and the greatest warrior of  's  .  named Achilles the most handsome of the heroes assembled against  . ,  Symposium ,  180a Later legends (beginning with a poem by   in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. As he died because of a small wound on his heel, the term   has come to mean a person's principal weakness. 
Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of   ( akhos ) "grief" and   ( Laos ) "a people, tribe, nation, etc." In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the  Iliad  (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of  kleos  (glory, usually glory in war). Laos  has been construed by  , following Leonard Palmer, to mean  a corps of soldiers , a  muster . With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership. The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC. Epigraphical database  gives 476 matches for Ἀχιλ-.The earliest ones:  Corinth 7th c. BC , Delphi 530 BC , Attica and Elis 5th c. BC.  It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία ( Achilleía ) attested in Attica in the 4th century BC ( IG  II² 1617) and, in the form  Achillia , on a  stele in Halicarnassus  as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon". Roman gladiatorial games often referenced classical mythology, and this seems to reference Achilles' fight with Penthesilea but gives it an extra twist of Achilles' being "played" by a woman.

Achilles was the son of the     and  , the king of the  .   and   had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until  , the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed  Peleus. ,  Prometheus Bound  755–768;  ,  Nemean  5.34–37,  Isthmian  8.26–47;   (ii.15) As with most mythology, there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in   (iv.760) Zeus' sister and wife   alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god  , was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus. thumb left ''The Education of Achilles'' (ca. 1772), by  James Barry According to the  , written by Statius in the 1st century AD, and to no surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal, by dipping him in the river  . However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him, his heel  (see  ,  ). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in   and put him on top of a fire, to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage. ,   4.869–879. However, none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the  Iliad  Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the   hero  , son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, "drawing a spurt of blood". Also, in the fragmentary poems of the   in which we can find description of the hero's death,  Kúpria  (unknown author),   by  ,  Ilias Mikrá  by Lesche of Mytilene, Iliou pérsis by  , there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body.

 thumb ''The Rage of Achilles'', by  The first two lines of the  Iliad  read:
: 
: :Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,
:the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the  Achaeans . Achilles' consuming rage is at times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative. According to the  Iliad , Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 Myrmidons (Book 2). He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon (Book 16). 
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in  , ruled by King  . In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that "he that wounded shall heal". Guided by the oracle, he arrived at  , where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy. According to other reports in  ' lost play about Telephus, he went to  Aulis  pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held  Orestes  for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound.   reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed. 
According to the   (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' Wrath), when the  Achaeans  desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of  , sacked neighboring cities and killed  . According to  '  Account of the Destruction of Troy ,  the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe,   was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King  's (or sometimes  ) and  's five legitimate sons. Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders. Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister  , and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth – who refusing to yield found instead himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo. Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace. In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege. James Davidson,  "Zeus Be Nice Now"  in  London Review of Books;  19 July 2007, accessed October 23, 2007  Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the   claimed Troy would have been invincible.

Homer's  Iliad  is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War.  Achilles' wrath is the central theme of the book. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by  , the commander of the  Achaean  forces. Agamemnon had taken a woman named   as his slave. Her father  , a priest of  , begged Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refused and Apollo sent a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet   correctly determined the source of the troubles but would not speak unless Achilles vowed to protect him. Achilles did so and Calchas declared Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consented, but then commanded that Achilles' battle prize   be brought to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonor (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis) Iliad  9.334–343.  and at the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refused to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At this same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles prayed to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honor. As the battle turned against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus,  Nestor  declared that the Trojans were winning because Agamemnon had angered Achilles, and urged the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agreed and sent   and two other chieftains,  Ajax  and  Phoenix , to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejected all Agamemnon offered him, and simply urged the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do. The Trojans, led by  , subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction,   led the   into battle wearing Achilles' armor, though Achilles remained at his camp. Patroclus succeeded in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but was killed by Hector before he could lead a proper assault on the city of Troy. thumb left 300px Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in front of the Gates of   (from a     on the upper level of the main hall of the  Achilleion ). After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from  , the son of Nestor, Achilles grieved over his beloved companion's death and held many funeral games in his honor. His mother Thetis came to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuaded   to make a new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector. The new armor included the  , described in great detail by the poet. Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ended his refusal to fight and took the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engaged in battle with the river god   who became angry that Achilles was choking his waters with all the men he killed. The god tried to drown Achilles but was stopped by   and Hephaestus. Zeus himself took note of Achilles' rage and sent the gods to restrain him so that he would not go on to sack Troy itself, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles could defy fate itself as Troy was not meant to be destroyed yet. Finally, Achilles found his prey. Achilles chased Hector around the wall of Troy three times before  , in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother,  , persuaded Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realized the trick, he knew the battle was inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charged at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but missed. Accepting his fate, Hector begged Achilles –not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles told Hector it was hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that "my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me". "The Iliad", Fagles translation. Penguin Books, 1991, p. 553.  Achilles then got his vengeance. With the assistance of the god  , Hector's father,  , went to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles to permit him to perform for Hector his funeral rites. The final passage in the  Iliad  is Hector's funeral, after which the doom of Troy was just a matter of time. 
Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the  Amazonian  warrior queen  , but later grieved over her death. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her. As he grieved over the death of such a rare beauty, a notorious Greek jeerer by the name of Thersites laughed and mocked the great Achilles. Annoyed by his insensitivity and disrespect, Achilles punched him in the face and killed him instantly.

Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles' closest companion was Nestor's son  . When  Memnon , king of  Ethiopia  slew Antilochus, Achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess. Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the  Iliad s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the  cyclic epic   , which was composed after the  Iliad , possibly in the 7th century B.C. The  Aethiopis  is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors. 
The death of Achilles, as predicted by   with his dying breath, was brought about by  Paris  with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god   guided Paris' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow. thumb Ajax carries off the body of Achilles:  Attic  black-figure '' '', ca. 510 BC, from Sicily ( , Munich) 
All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valor, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of  , and funeral games were held. He was represented in the lost Trojan War epic of   as living after his death in the island of   at the mouth of the river   (see below). Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses,  . Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him. Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus. Hamilton E. Mythology, New York: Penguin Books; 1969 Paris was later killed by   using the enormous bow of  . 
Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between   and  Telamonian Ajax  (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena. Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armor to  , the son of Achilles. A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of  , Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by  , who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the  Iliad  with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear, which he would indeed have touched with excitement. "Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles' original spear." Robin Lane Fox,  Alexander the Great  1973.144.  But it was being shown in the time of  Pausanias  in the 2nd century AD. Pausanias, iii.3.6; see Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl, "The Greek Traveler's Areas of Knowledge: Myths and Other Discourses in Pausanias' Description of Greece",  Yale French Studies   59 : Rethinking History: Time, Myth, and Writing (1980:65–85) esp. p. 81. 
 
The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the  Iliad , it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship, but commentators from   to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the  Greek custom of ''paiderasteia'' . In Plato's  Symposium , the participants in a dialogue about love debate assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.  Plato,  Symposium , translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Edition, page 8  But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish "heterosexual" and "homosexual," ,  Greek Homosexuality  (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1  et passim .  and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Although epic decorum excluded explicit sexuality, the  Iliad  indicates that Achilles had sexual relations with women, with no direct evidence of sexual behaviors with Patroclus. In the 2004 film  Troy , Achilles and Patroclus were cousins.

There was an archaic   of Achilles on the  White Island, ''Leuce'' , in the   off the modern coasts of   and  , with a temple and an   which survived into the Roman period. Guy Hedreen, "The Cult of Achilles in the Euxine"  Hesperia   60 .3 (July 1991), pp. 313–330. In the lost epic  , a continuation of the  Iliad  attributed to  Arktinus of Miletos ,  Achilles’ mother Thetis returned to mourn  him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a   for him and celebrated funeral games.  (IV.27.1) mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident ( Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara ), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from   by the  , and the temple there.  Pausanias  has been told that the island is "covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles’ temple and his statue" (III.19.11). Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.  tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister ( De situ orbis , II, 7). The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called  Leuce  "because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor" ( Orbis descriptio , v. 541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913). The  Periplus of the Euxine Sea  gives the following details: "It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus’ honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles’ temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles’ honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles’ oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships". (quoted in Densuşianu) The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the  Pontic Sea  but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea. Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as  Pontarches  the lord and master of the Pontic Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce  were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia ( ), Achilleios in Laconia ( Pausanias , III.25,4)   (Densuşianu 1913) even though he recognized Achilles in the name of   and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia ("Achileii"), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law." Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the  Delphic Pythia  sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound.   (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters ( aquae ) on the island. 
In the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city of   Greece, Empress of Austria   also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to  platonic   . The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles:  Achilleion  (Αχίλλειον). This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the  .

Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of  , king of  . There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name "Pyrrha" (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes' daughter  Deidamia , whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son,   (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet   that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away. Philostratus Junior ,  Imagines  i; Scholiast on Homer's Iliad, xix. 326;  ,  Metamorphoses  13.162ff., Pseudo-Apollodorus,  Bibliotheca  iii. 13. 8,  ,  , ii. 167ff. In book 11 of Homer's  , Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as "blessed in life, blessed in death", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction. This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the   on the Black Sea, the location of the mythical "White Island" which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes. The kings of the  Epirus  claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus.  , son of the Epirote princess  , could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor.

The  Greek tragedian    wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title  Achilleis  by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of   and eventual death when an arrow shot by  Paris  and guided by   punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the  Achilleis  and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the  Achilleis  trilogy,  The Myrmidons , focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today. Pantelis Michelakis,  Achilles in Greek Tragedy , 2002, p. 22  In Plato's Symposium, Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him  Plato,  Symposium , translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Editions, page 8 . The tragedian   also wrote  The Lovers of Achilles , a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive. 
The philosopher   centered one of  his paradoxes  on an imaginary footrace between "swift-footed"  Achilles and a tortoise , by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

Alabama is the  30th-most extensive  and the  23rd-most populous  of the  .  Alabama ranks second in the area of its inland waterways. From the   until  , Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers,  white  rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests and   were under-represented.  Following World War II, Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified interests in heavy manufacturing, mineral extraction, education, and technology.  In addition, the establishment or expansion of multiple military installations, primarily those of the   and  , added to state jobs. Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the  Yellowhammer  State , after the  state bird . Alabama is also known as the " Heart of Dixie ." The  state tree  is the  , the  state flower  is the  .

The  , a  Muskogean-speaking tribe  whose members lived just below the confluence of the  Coosa  and  s on the upper reaches of the  ,  served as the  etymological source  of the names of the river and state. In the  , the word for an Alabama person is  Albaamo  (or variously  Albaama  or  Albàamo  in different dialects; the plural form "Alabama persons" is  Albaamaha ).  The word  Alabama  is believed to have originated from the   and was later adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name.   The spelling of the word varies significantly between sources.   The first usage appears in three accounts of the   expedition of 1540 with   using  Alibamo , while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote  Alibamu  and  Limamu , respectively.   As early as 1702, the tribe was known to the French as  Alibamon  with French maps identifying the river as  Rivière des Alibamons .   Other spellings of the appellation have included  Alibamu ,  Alabamo ,  Albama ,  Alebamon ,  Alibama ,  Alibamou ,  Alabamu , and  Allibamou . The use of state names derived from  Native American languages  is common; an estimated 27 states have names of Native American origin.  Although the origin of  Alabama  could be discerned, sources disagree on its meaning. An 1842 article in the  Jacksonville Republican  originated the idea that the meaning was "Here We Rest."  This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of  .   Experts in the   have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation.   Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw  alba  (meaning "plants" or "weeds") and  amo  (meaning "to cut", "to trim", or "to gather").   The meaning may have been "clearers of the thicket"  or "herb gatherers"  which may refer to clearing of land for cultivation  or to collecting medicinal plants.

Analysis of  artifacts  recovered from   excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the   (SECC).  Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to  n culture, but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood. Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were   -speaking  , and the  -speaking  Alabama  ( Alibamu ),  ,  ,  Creek ,  , and  Mobile . 
The French founded the first European settlement in the region at  Old Mobile , in 1702.  The area was French from 1702 to 1763; part of British   from 1763 to 1780. Thomas Bassett was the first British settler in the state. He settled near what is now   in  Washington County .  Alabama became part of Spanish West Florida from 1780 to 1810; part of the independent   for a short time (90 days); annexed by the U.S. and added to the   (1810); and, finally, added to the   in 1812. Throughout these later developments, however, the Spanish had kept a nominal (although largely ignored) governmental presence in the region, based out of  Mobile . When  's forces occupied Mobile in 1814 —while preparing for the   —he demonstrated the United States'  de facto  authority over the region, effectively ending Spanish governance (though not its claim), while gaining an unencumbered passage to the gulf. The area making up today's northern and central Alabama, known as the  , had been claimed by the   after 1763. Following the  Revolutionary War , it remained a part of the  state of Georgia  —although heavily disputed. Conflicting claims to the area were held, first by several Native American  s (most notably the  Chickamauga-Cherokee  and  Yazoo ), by other states (e.g.  ); and by the  US federal government ;  Britain  and Spain. In 1802, the region was joined to the  .  Individual statehood was delayed, however, by the territory's lack of a coastline. 
 thumb left Old Alabama state capital ruins at Capital Park in  Tuscaloosa   Alabama was admitted to the Union in 1819 as the 22nd state.  Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men. Settlers rapidly arrived to take advantage of the fertile soil. Southeastern planters and traders from the   brought  slaves  with them as the cotton   expanded. The economy of the central " Black Belt " (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton   whose owners' wealth grew largely from slave labor.  The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became  . The 1860 census records show that enslaved Africans comprised 45% of the state's total population of 964,201. There were only 2,690  free persons of color  living in Alabama at the time. From 1826 to 1846,  Tuscaloosa  served as the capital of Alabama. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to remove the capital city from Tuscaloosa to  Montgomery . The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847. In time, a Capitol building was erected under the direction of a  , Pennsylvania architect. The original structure burnt down in 1849 but was rebuilt in 1851 following the original plans.

During  Reconstruction , the new state legislators created a public school system for the first time, as well as establishing some welfare institutions to help its people.  Alabama was officially restored to the Union in 1868. After the Civil War, the state was still chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton.  Planters resisted working with free labor during  Reconstruction  and sought to re-establish controls over  . In the early years the   had numerous independent chapters in Alabama that attacked freedmen and other Republicans.  After it was suppressed,   whites organized paramilitary groups, such as the  Red Shirts  and  , that acted more openly to suppress black voting.  Regaining power by the late 1870s, in the last decade of the 19th century, white Democrats passed electoral laws  disfranchise  most blacks and many poor whites. J. Morgan Kousser.

 thumb School in Alabama ( , 1935) The new 1901   effectively disfranchised African Americans and many poor whites through voting restrictions, including literacy requirements.

In 1900, 14  Black Belt  counties had more than 79,000 voters on the rolls.  By June 1, 1903, the number of   registered voters had dropped to 1,081. In 1900, Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903, only 2,980 had qualified to register, although at least 74,000 black voters were  . By 1941, a total of more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 whites to 520,000 blacks. Glenn Feldman.  The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama . Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.  Nearly all African Americans lost the ability to vote. The disfranchisement was ended  by African Americans' leading the   and gaining Federal legislation in the mid-1960s to protect their voting and civil rights.  The   also protected the   of poor whites. The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans in the segregated state, but did not relieve them of paying taxes.  Continued racial discrimination, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to   infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities. They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the  Great Migration  to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities. The population growth rate in Alabama (see "Historical Populations" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920, reflecting the effect of emigration. At the same time, many rural whites and blacks migrated to the city of  Birmingham  for work in new industrial jobs. It experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed "The Magic City." By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the U.S. and held more than 30% of the population of the state. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of the economy. thumb left This structure greets drivers visiting the Alabama Welcome Center just inside the AL/GA border off of  . Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought prosperity.  Cotton faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base. In the 1960s under Governor  , many whites in the state opposed federal integration efforts in schools and public facilities. 
Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham. One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services.  Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, "A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature." African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons, but they were disfranchised. White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction. These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefs. During the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national  ,  and the  .   segregation ended in the states as   were invalidated or repealed. Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to properly redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature. In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature implemented the Alabama constitution's provision for periodic redistricting based on population.  This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years. After 1972, the state's white voters shifted much of their support to Republican candidates in presidential elections (as also occurred in neighboring southern states). Since 1990 the majority of whites in the state have voted increasingly Republican in state elections.  In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.

The northern part of the state – along the Tennessee Valley – is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as  , as distinct from the   of the Southern Plains. Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the southeastern United States, with average January low temperatures around   in Mobile and around   in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years.  Historic snowfall events include   and the  .  The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is   per year.  In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall. Alabama's highest recorded temperature of   was recorded on September 5, 1925 in the unincorporated community of  Centerville .   was the state's record low recorded in 1966 in  New Market .  class="wikitable collapsible collapsed" style="width:90%; text-align:center; font-size:90%; line-height: 1.1em; margin:auto;"

The   estimates that the population of Alabama was 4,802,740 on July 1, 2011, a 0.48% increase since the  . The  , as of July 1, 2008, estimated Alabama's population at 4,661,900,    which represents an increase of 214,545, or 4.8%, since the last census in 2000.    This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 people (that is 502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 people into the state.   Immigration  from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people.   The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were illegal immigrants (24,000). The   of Alabama is located in  Chilton County , outside of the town of  Jemison . 
According to the  , Alabama had a population of 4,779,736. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 68.5% White (67.0% Non-Hispanic White Alone), 26.2% Black or African American, 0.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.1% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 2.0% from Some Other Race, and 1.5% from Two or More Races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 3.9% of the population. The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are: African American (26.2%),  English  (23.6%),  Irish  (7.7%),  German  (5.7%), and  Scots-Irish  (2.0%).   Those citing "American" ancestry in Alabama are of overwhelmingly English extraction, however most  s identify simply as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in some cases since the 1600s.  Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher.  In the 1980 census, 41% of the people in Alabama cited that they were of English ancestry, making them the largest ethnic group at the time.

 The foundational document for Alabama's government is the  , which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the  .   There is a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.  This movement is based upon the fact that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism. Alabama is divided into three equal branches:
The   is the  , a   assembly composed of the  , with 105 members, and the  , with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation.  The  Republican Party  currently holds a majority in both houses of the  Legislature . The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto). The   is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the  . Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the  , the  , the  , the  , and the  . The current  governor  of the state is  Republican   Robert Bentley . The  lieutenant governor  is Republican  . The   is responsible for interpreting the  Constitution  and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The highest court is the  . The Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican  .  All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. The statewide officials, such as the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, and other constitutional offices take office in the following January. 
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the standard deduction. Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct federal Social Security and Medicare taxes. The state's general sales tax rate is 4%. Comparison of State and Local Retail Sales Taxes , July 2004 Retrieved on May 25, 2007.  The collection rate could be substantially higher, depending upon additional city and county sales taxes. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 11% tax on a meal. Sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide. Alabama is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine. Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the nation's very highest.  Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line.  Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes. The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.    es are the lowest in the United States. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes. Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 million. 
 Alabama has 67  counties . Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the County Commission, which usually also has executive authority in the county. Because of the restraints placed in the  , all but seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no  . Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.

 thumb Alabama Governor Robert Bentley During  Reconstruction  following the  , Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the   under  General John Pope . In 1874, the political coalition known as the   took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African American vote. After 1890, a coalition of whites passed laws to  segregate  and disenfranchise black residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor whites, however. By 1941 more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised. From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972. Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the  American Civil Rights Movement , when majority whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Democrat  , the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Federal   and   of 1965 did African-Americans regain suffrage and other civil rights. In 2007, the   passed, and Republican Governor   signed, a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the  , which housed Congress of the  . 
 
With the disfranchisement of African Americans, the state became part of the " ", a system in which the  Democratic Party  became essentially the only political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100 years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party  primary , with generally only token  Republican  challengers running in the General Election. Republicans hold all nine seats on the   and all ten seats on the state appellate courts.  Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. This change also began, likely in part, due to the same perception by voters of Democratic party efforts to disenfranchise voters again in 1994.  In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama,  , refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican  .  Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.  This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench. Republicans hold all seven of the  statewide elected executive  branch offices.  Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the  .  In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years.  Democrats hold one of the three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission. Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since Reconstruction, one is  , the current Lieutenant Governor. 
Many local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Local elections in most rural counties are generally decided in the Democratic primary and local elections in metropolitan and suburban counties are generally decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions. Alabama's 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan races and Democrats still retain the majority of those posts.  The current split is 42  Democrats , 24  Republicans , and one Independent (Choctaw). Alabama Sheriff's Association   However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties and the majority of Republican sheriffs preside over more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties.  Two Alabama counties (Montgomery and Calhoun) with a population of over 100,000 have Democratic sheriffs and five  Alabama counties  with a population of under 75,000 have Republican sheriffs (Autauga, Coffee, Dale, Coosa, and Blount).   The state has one female sheriff (Morgan) and nine African-American sheriffs. Alabama Sheriffs Association

Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the overview of the   as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,541 individual schools provide education for 743,364 elementary and secondary students. Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year.  In 2007, over 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National   law, using measures determined by the State of Alabama. In 2004, 23 percent of schools met AYP. While Alabama's public education system has improved, > it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data, Alabama's high school graduation rate – 75% – is the fourth lowest in the United States (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi). http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf   The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.

 A  ( named   a   , plural  aes )  is the first  letter  and a   in the  . It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter  , from which it derives. 
The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is   (also called 'aleph), the first letter of the   (which, by consisting entirely of  s, is an   rather than a true  ). In turn, the origin of aleph may have been a   of an   head in  s.

When the  ancient Greeks  adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the  —the first   of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter, and the sound that the letter denoted in  Phoenician  and other  —so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel  , and gave it the similar name of  alpha . In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the  , dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the   of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set. The   brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the   and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the  Etruscan alphabet  to write the  , and the resulting letter was preserved in the  Latin alphabet  used to write many languages, including  English . right thumb 200 Typographic variants include a double-story '''a''' and single-story '''ɑ'''. 
The letter has two  minuscule  (lower-case) forms. The form used in most current   consists of a circle and vertical stroke ( ), called   or "script a". This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter   in the hands of dark-age Irish and English writers.  Most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ( ). Both derive from the   (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the Uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the   that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form. 
 
The letter A currently represents six different vowel sounds. In English, "a" by itself frequently denotes the   ( ) as in  pad ; the   ( ) as in  father , its original, Latin and Greek, sound; a closer, further fronted sound as in "hare", which developed as the sound progressed from "father" to "ace";  in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong   as in  ace  and  major , due to effects of the  ; the more rounded form in "water" or its closely related cousin, found in "was". In most other languages that use the Latin alphabet, "a" denotes an   ( ). In the  International Phonetic Alphabet , variants of "a" denote various  s. In  , capital "A" denotes the   and lowercase "a" denotes the  . "A" is the third most commonly used letter in English, and the second most common in  Spanish  and  French . In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English tend to be ⟨a⟩, while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French. "A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; A grade for clean restaurants;   celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a  motivating  effect as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.

 <Albedo> 
 thumb Percentage of diffusely reflected sun light in relation to various surface conditions of the Earth Albedo  ( ), or  reflection coefficient , derived from    albedo  "whiteness" (or reflected sunlight), in turn from  albus  "white", is the  diffuse reflectivity  or reflecting power of a surface. It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Being a  dimensionless  fraction, it may also be expressed as a percentage, and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface, to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface. Albedo depends on the   of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of  . In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation.  Exceptions are   surfaces, which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function, so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution. In practice, a   (BRDF) may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately, although the albedo is a very useful first approximation. The albedo is an important concept in   and  , as well as in calculating   of surfaces in LEED sustainable rating systems for buildings, computer graphics and computer vision. The average overall albedo of Earth, its  planetary albedo , is 30 to 35%, because of the covering by clouds, but varies widely locally across the surface, depending on the geological and environmental features.

Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow, to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a  . When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, while desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.  The average albedo of the   is about 0.3.  This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds. Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult. The classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature  . If a snow-covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of  ; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics. thumb 200px left 2003-2004 mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo 
The Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via   satellite sensors such as  's   instruments on board the  Terra  and  Aqua  satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a   of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of   and bi-hemispherical reflectance.  (e. g.,
. ) The Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the   is currently about 15 °C. For the frozen (more reflective) planet the average temperature is below −40 °C  (If only all continents being completely covered by glaciers - the mean temperature is about 0 °C ). The simulation for (more absorptive) aquaplanet shows the average temperature close to 27 °C. 
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular solar  zenith angle   {\theta_i}  can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle,  {\bar \alpha(\theta_i)} , and the bi-hemispherical reflectance,  \bar{ \bar \alpha}  the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination  {D} . Albedo  {\alpha}  can then be given as: : {\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.  is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and   as white sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface. 
The albedos of  s,  satellites  and  s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of  photometry . For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about   properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in  s. Enceladus , a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is  Eris , with an albedo of 0.96
. 
 
  Many small objects in the outer solar system  and   have low albedos down to about 0.05.   A typical   has an albedo of 0.04.   Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily  space weathered  surface containing some  s. The overall albedo of the   is around 0.12, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect.  While such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the   surfaces of airless solar system bodies. Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band)   (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the   (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion. In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five   which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with  phase angle , including a characterization of the   of   surfaces. The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo,  absolute magnitude  and diameter is: 
 A =\left ( \frac{1329\times10^{-H/5}}{D} \right ) ^2 , where  A  is the astronomical albedo,  D  is the diameter in kilometres, and  H  is the absolute magnitude. 
 
Although the albedo-temperature effect is best known in colder, whiter regions on Earth, the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater.  The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between 3 and 12 degrees north.   The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the north and south hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination. 
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing. 
Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby could produce localized climate cooling (ignoring the lost evaporative cooling effect of trees).  s further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.   have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 while   have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15. Studies by the   have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of   on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming. 
Snow albedos can be as high as 0.9; this, however, is for the ideal example: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over   they average a little more than 0.8.  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo  ).  , powdery windblown   containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.

Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the   (see graph).
 thumb right 250px 1.333) 
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally  specular manner  (not  diffusely ). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small  angles of incident  light,   results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle. Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the Earth near the  terminator  (early morning, late afternoon and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light. Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh ‘black’ ice exhibits Fresnel reflection. 
  has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. "On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth." Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the  s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.  A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 °C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies. 
  (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on the Earth’s radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as   and thereby change   properties) is less certain.  As per   the effects are:
 
 
  ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.  ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called  . Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect''). 
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the   estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m −2 , with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m −2 . 
  is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ( ); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

 <Autism> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Autism  is a  disorder of neural development  characterized by impaired  social interaction  and  , and by restricted and repetitive behavior. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old.  Autism affects information processing in the  brain  by altering how nerve cells and their  s connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.  It is one of three recognized disorders in the   (ASDs), the other two being  , which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and  pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified  (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met. Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the  genetics of autism  are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare  s, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants.  In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with  agents that cause birth defects .   Controversies  surround other proposed environmental  causes , such as  heavy metals ,  s or childhood  s;  the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence.  The   of autism is about 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide, and the   (CDC) report 11.3 per 1,000 children in the United States are diagnosed with ASD as of 2008.  The number of people diagnosed with autism has increased dramatically since the 1990s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.  The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first develop more normally and then  regress .   Early behavioral  or cognitive intervention can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and communication skills.  Although there is no known cure,  there have been reported cases of children who recovered.  Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.  An  autistic culture  has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder. 
Autism is a highly variable   that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without  remission .  Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years,  and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.  It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.  Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits. 
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related  s (ASD; see  Classification ) from other developmental disorders.  People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic   described her inability to understand the   of  s, or people with normal  , as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars". Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.  Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from  ; for example, they have less   and turn taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as the deficiency to point at things.  Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form  attachments  to their primary caregivers.  Most autistic children display moderately less  attachment security  than non-autistic children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.  Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition. Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply. There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD.  The limited data suggest that, in children with mental retardation, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and  s. A 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in non-autistic children with language impairments.  A 2008 Swedish study found that, of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD, those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as  . 
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.  Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of  , unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ( )  or  reverse pronouns .    seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD:  for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,  and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.  Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language. In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends. Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)  categorizes as follows. thumb Young boy asleep on a bed, facing the camera, with only the head visible and the body off-camera. On the bed behind the boy's head is a dozen or so toys carefully arranged in a line, ordered by size. A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in order of size ''' ''' is repetitive movement, such as hand flapping, making sounds, head rolling, or body rocking. ''' ''' is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in stacks or lines. '''Sameness''' is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted. ''' Ritualistic behavior ''' involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors. '''Restricted behavior''' is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game. ''' ''' includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as eye poking,  , hand biting, and head banging.  A 2007 study reported that self-injury at some point affected about 30% of children with ASD. No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors. 
Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.  This paper represents a consensus of representatives from nine professional and four parent organizations in the US. 
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious  autistic savant s.  Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. 
 Sensory  abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some,  although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.  Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). 
An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include  ,  poor motor planning , and  ;  deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper. Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur;  this does not appear to result in  . Although some children with autism also have   (GI) symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual;  studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between GI problems and ASD is unclear. Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of  stress .  Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children or those with  ; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults. Autism is one of the five  s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.  These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance. Of the five PDD forms,   is closest to autism in signs and likely causes;   and   share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes;   (PDD-NOS; also called  atypical autism ) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.  Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in  .  The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the  autism spectrum disorders  (ASD)  or sometimes the  autistic disorders ,  whereas autism itself is often called  autistic disorder ,  childhood autism , or  infantile autism . In this article,  autism  refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though,  autism ,  ASD , and  PDD  are often used interchangeably.  ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism  , which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like  traits , such as avoiding eye contact. The manifestations of autism cover a wide  spectrum , ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent,  , and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose,   communication.  Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.  Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or   (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on   thresholds,  or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial. Autism can also be divided into  syndromal  and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound   or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as  .  Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the  overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism  is unclear. Validity of ASD subtypes:
 
Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that   is a specific subtype,  A partial update is in:   or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression. Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population  and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of  ,  ,   and  .  Newer technologies such as   and   can help identify biologically relevant  s (observable traits) that can be viewed on  s, to help further   studies of autism;  one example is lowered activity in the   of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects.  It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior. 
 It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms.  However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur. thumb Three diagrams of chromosome pairs A, B that are nearly identical. 1: B is missing a segment of A. 2: B has two adjacent copies of a segment of A. 3: B's copy of A's segment is in reverse order. Deletion (1), duplication (2) and inversion (3) are all   that have been implicated in autism. 
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the  genetics of autism  are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare  s with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants.  Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and   factors which do not change   but are heritable and influence  .  Studies of twins suggest that   is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population.  However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a   (single-gene) mutation or to a single  , and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD.  Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene.  The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from  s—spontaneous  deletions  or  duplications  in genetic material during  .  Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome. Several lines of evidence point to  synaptic  dysfunction as a cause of autism.  Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with  .  Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes.  All known  s (agents that cause  s) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from  conception , and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development. Although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies,  extensive searches are underway.   s that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism, or may be important in future research, include certain foods,  ,  ,  s,  ,  ,   and  s used in   products,  s,  s,  alcohol ,  ,  s,  s,  and  ,  although no links have been found, and some have been completely disproven. Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming  vaccine "overload" , a  vaccine preservative , or the  MMR vaccine  for causing autism.  The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been "an elaborate fraud".  Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible,  parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of  ,  outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases  in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children. Vaccines and autism:
 
 
Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.  How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the   of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the   linkages between brain structures and behaviors.  The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies. 
 thumb Two diagrams of major brain structures implicated in autism. The upper diagram shows the cerebral cortex near the top and the basal ganglia in the center, just above the amygdala and hippocampus. The lower diagram shows the corpus callosum near the center, the cerebellum in the lower rear, and the brain stem in the lower center. Autism affects the  ,  , and many other parts of the brain. 
Unlike many other brain disorders, such as  , autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular, cellular, or systems level; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways, or is (like intellectual disability) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms.  Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems,  and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product.    studies and the associations with   strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception.  This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors.  Just after birth, the brains of autistic children tend to grow faster than usual, followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood. It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all autistic children. It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization.  Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following:
  An excess of  s that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions.  Disturbed   during early  .  Unbalanced excitatory–inhibitory networks.  Abnormal formation of  s and  s,  for example, by modulation of the  –   cell-adhesion  system,  or by poorly regulated  synthesis  of synaptic proteins.  Disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to  , which may explain why the two conditions are associated. 
Interactions between the   and the   begin early during the  embryonic stage  of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. Aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is possibly part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD.  Although some abnormalities in the immune system have been found in specific subgroups of autistic individuals, it is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to or secondary to autism's disease processes.  As   are found in conditions other than ASD, and are not always present in ASD,  the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial. The relationship of  s to autism is not well understood; several have been investigated, with the most evidence for the role of   and of genetic differences in its transport.  The role of group I   (mGluR) in the pathogenesis of  ,  the most common identified genetic cause of autism, has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway.  Some data suggest an increase in several  s; other data argue for diminished  s.  Also, some   are associated with autism, but probably account for less than 5% of cases. The   (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions. MNS and autism:
  Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD.  However, individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS  and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object. 
 thumb upright A human brain viewed from above. About 10% is highlighted in yellow and 10% in blue. There is only a tiny (perhaps 0.5%) green region where they overlap. Autistic individuals tend to use different areas of the brain (yellow) for a movement task compared to a control group (blue). 
ASD-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks. 
In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the  , a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing, with intact connectivity of the  , used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking. In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of   thought.  A 2008 brain-imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the   which differs in individuals with ASD. The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes.  Evidence for this theory has been found in   studies on autistic individuals  and by a  brainwave  study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the  cortex  and weak functional connections between the   and the rest of the cortex.  Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each  hemisphere  of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the  association cortex . From studies based on  s, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli.  For example,   studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals. In the genetic area, relations have been found between autism and   based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with  .  Research on autism/schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 (15q13.3), chromosome 16 (16p13.1) and chromosome 17 (17p12) are inconclusive. 
Two major categories of   theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior. The first category focuses on deficits in  . The   postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing;  this extension is controversial, as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects. These theories are somewhat related to the earlier   approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the   for reasoning about others' motivations,  and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in  Pathophysiology  maps well to the hypothesis.  However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints. The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing.   hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in  , planning,  inhibition , and other forms of executive function.  Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.  A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;  two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure  and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children.  hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.  A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and   operations in autistic individuals.  These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism. Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.  A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful. 
About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months.  According to an article in the  Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders , failure to meet any of the following milestones  "is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome." 
 No   by 12 months. No  gesturing  (pointing, waving bye-bye, etc.) by 12 months. No single words by 16 months. No two-word spontaneous (''not just  echolalic '') phrases by 24 months. ''Any'' loss of ''any'' language or social skills, ''at any age''. US and Japanese practice is to  screen  all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective.  Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor CHAT on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low  sensitivity  (many false-negatives) but good  specificity  (few false-positives).  It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders.  Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture.  Although   for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and  s. 
 Diagnosis  is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism.  Autism is defined in the   as exhibiting at least six symptoms total, including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction, at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication, and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. Onset must be prior to age three years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by   or  .    uses essentially the same definition. Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the   (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the   (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The   (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children. A   commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated  .  A pediatric   is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.  A   for ASD at this stage might also consider  ,  , and a   such as  .  The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as  depression .  evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.  Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,  consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and   testing.  A  -first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.   As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics.    and   tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine. ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.  In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.  A 2009 US study found the average age of formal ASD diagnosis was 5.7 years, far above recommendations, and that 27% of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years.  Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits. Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.  It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the  , partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or  s.

The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs.  Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment.  Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about  .  Although many   interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of  s of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options.  Intensive, sustained   programs and   early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills,  and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors;  claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated.  Available approaches include   (ABA), developmental models,  structured teaching ,  ,   therapy, and  . Educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children: intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children  and is well-established for improving intellectual performance of young children.  Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided.  It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up,  and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.  The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers. Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails.  More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed  s or  s, with the most common drug classes being  s,  s, and  s.  Aside from antipsychotics,  there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. Lack of research on drug treatments:
  A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications, the medications can have  adverse effects ,  and no known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments.  Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function,  suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism. 
Although many  alternative therapies and interventions  are available, few are supported by scientific studies. Lack of support for interventions:
  Treatment approaches have little empirical support in  quality-of-life  contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance.  Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests.   Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. A 2008 study found that compared to their peers, autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on  s;  in 2005, botched   killed a five-year-old child with autism. Treatment is expensive; indirect costs are more so. For someone born in 2000, a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of $  (  in   dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate),  with about 10%  , 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity.  Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems;  one 2008 US study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD,  and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that   problems will greatly affect parental employment.  US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services, shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance.  After childhood, key treatment issues include residential care, job training and placement, sexuality, social skills, and  . 
There is no known cure.  Children recover occasionally, so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD;  this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often recovery happens;  reported rates in unselected samples of children with ASD have ranged from 3% to 25%.  Most autistic children can acquire language by age 5 or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years.  Most children with autism lack  , meaningful relationships, future employment opportunities or  self-determination .  Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.  Few high-quality studies address long-term  . Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife.  Acquiring language before age six, having an   above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes;   is unlikely with severe autism.  A 2004 British study of 68 adults who were diagnosed before 1980 as autistic children with IQ above 50 found that 12% achieved a high level of independence as adults, 10% had some friends and were generally in work but required some support, 19% had some independence but were generally living at home and needed considerable support and supervision in daily living, 46% needed specialist residential provision from facilities specializing in ASD with a high level of support and very limited autonomy, and 12% needed high-level hospital care.  A 2005 Swedish study of 78 adults that did not exclude low IQ found worse prognosis; for example, only 4% achieved independence.  A 2008 Canadian study of 48 young adults diagnosed with ASD as preschoolers found outcomes ranging through poor (46%), fair (32%), good (17%), and very good (4%); 56% of these young adults had been employed at some point during their lives, mostly in volunteer, sheltered or   work.  Changes in diagnostic practice and increased availability of effective early intervention make it unclear whether these findings can be generalized to recently diagnosed children.

Reports of autism cases per 1,000 children grew dramatically in the US from 1996 to 2007. It is unknown how much, if any, growth came from changes in autism's  . 
Most recent  s tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD;  because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true prevalence.   's prevalence has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and   at 0.02 per 1,000.  The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness,  though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out.  The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased;  a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics. Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with mental retardation and more than 5.5:1 without.  Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.  The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism.  Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism. Several other conditions are common in children with autism.  They include:
 ''' s'''. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable   (single-gene) condition,  , or other genetic syndrome,  and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders. ''' '''. The fraction of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for mental retardation has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence.  For ASD other than autism, the association with mental retardation is much weaker. ''' s''' are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms. ''' ''', with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of  . Several ''' s''', such as  , are associated with autistic symptoms. ''' ''' are significantly increased in the autistic population. '''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for  ,  , and other of these conditions are often present and these  comorbid diagnoses  are increasingly accepted. '''Sleep problems''' affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of   such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent  nocturnal awakenings , and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The  Table Talk  of  , compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.  Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report.  The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance.  The  , a   caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student  Jean Itard  treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation. The   word  autismus  (English translation  autism ) was coined by the   psychiatrist   in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of  . He derived it from the Greek word  autós  (αὐτός, meaning  self ), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance".  The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original. The word  autism  first took its modern sense in 1938 when   of the  Vienna University Hospital  adopted Bleuler's terminology  autistic psychopaths  in a lecture in German about  .  Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as  , though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.    of the   first used  autism  in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label  early infantile autism  in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.  Reprinted in   Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.  It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger. Kanner's reuse of  autism  led to decades of confused terminology like  infantile schizophrenia , and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to " s". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.  As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.  Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD,  parents continue to feel   in situations where their autistic children's behaviors are perceived negatively by others,  and many  s and  s still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research. The   has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.    have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.
